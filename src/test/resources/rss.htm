His department has named &lt;a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement230610a.htm"&gt;157 magistrates' and county courts earmarked for closure&lt;/a&gt; and it has launched a consultation exercise. The proposal would save £37m a year. Jonathan Djanogly, the courts minister, said: "We now have the opportunity to think afresh about how we can create a more modern fit-for-purpose justice system in line with the way we live our lives today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;George Osborne, the chancellor, suggested that welfare cuts could go even deeper&lt;/strong&gt;. In an interview on the Today programme, he said the government could avoid 25% cuts in government departments where spending won't be protected if it could find welfare cuts to add to the £11bn cuts already planned. (See 8.43am)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that Britain faces "the longest, deepest sustained period of cuts to public services spending, at least since world war two"&lt;/strong&gt;. It has also said that claims the budget was progressive were "debatable". (See 1.20pm)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Harriet Harman accused David Cameron of breaking promises in the budget&lt;/strong&gt;. At PMQs, the acting Labour leader said that the Tories promised at the election that no family earning less than £40,000 a year would lose child tax credit. She said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the budget red book shows that there are families on a joint income of £30,000 who will lose all their tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron replied: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You talk about broken promises. We remember 'no more boom and bust'. What happened to that promise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Lord Walker, the Tory former cabinet minster and energy secretary during the miners' strike, has died&lt;/strong&gt;. (See 11.05am and 1.14pm)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Cameron has said that he would like to "re-examine" the rules that allow Sinn Féin MPs to claim parliamentary expenses even though they do not take their seats&lt;/strong&gt;. But Sir George Young, the leader of the Commons, said earlier this month that the payment of allowances was no longer a matter for the government and that it was was now dealt with by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;The Department for Education said it would publish a list of schools expressing an interest in becoming academies on Friday&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Cameron sent a message of support to the England team at PMQs, ahead of this afternoon's game&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 37 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.40pm:&lt;/strong&gt; I posted my thoughts on PMQs at 12.47pm. Here are some other assessments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8755840.stm"&gt;BBC's Reeta Chakrabarti:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour MPs continued the charge led by Harriet Harman on the effect of the Budget on poorer people. They were batted away on the whole by David Cameron with the accusation that Labour had run out of answers and had failed to do enough on child poverty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably just the luck of the draw, but there were few Lib Dem backbench questions, so it was hard to gauge the mood post-Budget amongst them, although one, Julian Huppert, did signal unhappiness over not including Trident in the Strategic Defence Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2010/06/live-blog-of-pmqs-1.html"&gt;ConservativeHome's Jonathan Isaby:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A confident performance from David Cameron, with Harriet Harman clutching at straws in her questioning on the Budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jameskirkup/100044580/pmqs-harriet-harman-is-the-wrong-person-asking-the-right-questions/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;James Kirkup at the Telegraph:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Harman is not famed for her command of detailed policy, and her attempts to assault the PM with charts and figures faltered because of her own obvious discomfort with the material. That doesn't mean the questions were the wrong ones. Indeed, there could well be some important issues to explore here. But Ms Harman is probably not the right person to be asking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.progressives.org.uk/articles/article.asp?a=6150"&gt;Rupa Huq at Progress Online:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron started off well, looking bronzed as well as well-fed and after nearly five years at the top of his party, conveying confidence and fluency. However, he soon came unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 36 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.20pm:&lt;/strong&gt; The Institute for Fiscal Studies budget briefing has started. My colleague &lt;strong&gt;Larry Elliott&lt;/strong&gt; is there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that Robert Chote, the IFS director, has said we are looking at "the longest, deepest sustained period of cuts to public services spending, at least since world war two". Chote also said that the claim that the budget was progressive was "debatable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll post more from the briefing later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 35 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.14pm:&lt;/strong&gt; This is from Chris Moncrieff's Press Association obituary of Lord Walker (see 11.05am):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other Tory "wets" and "moderates" were ousted one by one from her Cabinets, Lord Walker managed to keep his place, despite frequent furious rows with the then prime minister and occasional public criticism - although well-disguised - of some of her social policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lord Walker was the master of the coded speech. He used to produce elaborate addresses which could never be taken at face value. One had to read between the lines, and sometimes even between the words, to winkle out a message that was "Thatcher-sceptic" in content. Yet superficially, there appeared to be nothing disloyal about the speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This used to infuriate Margaret Thatcher who, it is believed, tried to get rid of him without actually sacking him. After the 1987 general election, she offered him the post of Welsh Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one of the most senior Cabinet ministers - he also served in Edward Heath's Cabinet - this looked like something bordering on an insult which he would have to refuse.&lt;br /&gt;But he not only accepted the new job, he did so with acclaim, leaving the impression that he felt himself now to be the King of Wales. He was a man always with his eye on publicity, and he turned out to be one of the most spectacular incumbents of this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 34 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.08pm:&lt;/strong&gt; My colleagues at the money blog are running &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/blog/2010/jun/21/live-clinic-2010-budget"&gt;a live online budget clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Frank Nash of accountants &lt;a href="http://www.blickrothenberg.com/Home"&gt;Blick Rothenberg&lt;/a&gt;, Martin Bamford of independent financial advisers &lt;a href="http://www.icl-ifa.co.uk/"&gt;Informed Choice&lt;/a&gt;, and Darran Hills, a counsellor with the benefits and debt advisory charity the &lt;a href="http://www.cccs.co.uk/"&gt;Consumer Credit Counselling Service&lt;/a&gt;, are available to answer questions about the budget and its implications until 1.30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 33 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.04pm:&lt;/strong&gt; David Cameron will have his first meeting as prime minister with President Obama on Saturday, Downing Street has announced. The two men will attend a bilateral meeting on the fringe of the G8 and G20 summits in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 32 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.47pm:&lt;/strong&gt; What's the verdict? Harriet Harman had Cameron bang to rights on tax credits. (The Tories said during the election that families earning up to £40,000 would not lose out, but that is not now true.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, instead of making this her main question, she began by making a rather more arcane point about the coalition's pension guarantee, which does not cost the Treasury any extra money this year or next year, although it will cost the Treasury £450m a year by 2014-15. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron dodged both questions and instead resorted to predictable blather about the economic mess being all Labour's fault. He also needs to either abandon his joke about Star Trek, or explain to us all what it is supposed to mean. But he did have an answer, of sorts, to complaints that the budget will disadvantage the poor in the long-term. He said there will be other budgets in the future, implying that more anti-poverty measures could be introduced in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 31 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.33pm:&lt;/strong&gt; In response to a question about child poverty, Cameron says that it went up after 2004 under Labour. But, because the government put a great deal of money into child tax credits, the budget measures will not increase child poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 30 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.31pm:&lt;/strong&gt; In response to a question about Sinn Féin not taking their seats in the Commons, Cameron says that they have been "let off the hook". He says he would like to re-examine this. He suggests he would like to stop the arrangement that allows them to claim parliamentary expenses even though they do not attend the Commons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 29 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.29pm:&lt;/strong&gt; A Tory MP asks about Labour's benefit plans, which would have showed below-inflation rises for next year. Cameron says "the dupes" sitting behind the Labour frontbenches did not realise this. He says there was a £300m black hole in Labour's benefit spending plans. Rather bizarrely, he says that any Star Trek fan should know that when you are in a black hole, you should stop digging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Last week Cameron made a joke about the Labour leadership contest being like a Star Trek convention. I think he's trying label David Miliband as a Mr Spock character, but the reference isn't clear.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiona Mactaggart (Labour) asks Cameron to publish tables showing what the distributional effects of the budget will be in future years. Cameron says that he is looking forward to future coalition budgets that could help the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 28 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.23pm:&lt;/strong&gt; A Labour MP asks about Sky News. He asks for an assurance that regulatory changes will not lead to Sky become like Fox News in the US. Cameron says that's a matter for Vince Cable, the business secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 27 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.22pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Helen Goodman (Labour) asks Cameron how many children will be living in poverty at the end of the parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says that, unlike Labour, the coalition published distributional tables showing the impact of its budget measures on the poor. He says that there will be another three coalition budgets that will allow the government to do more to help the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 26 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.20pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Asked about BP, Cameron says he has had two conversations with President Obama, including one last night. He says that he told the US president that it was in everyone's interests that BP remains strong and stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 25 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.19pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Chris Evans (Labour) asks Cameron to accept he has let Wales down. Cameron doesn't accept that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela Nash (Labour) asks about aid spending. She is sitting next to Stephen Timms, the former minister who is back in the Commons after having been stabbed while holding a constituency surgery. Cameron congratulated Nash on being the youngest MP in the Commons (she's 25) and says that he's committed to aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 24 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.14pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Karen Buck (Labour) asks if there will be fewer police officers at the end of the parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says Labour MPs have got to get serious. If they want to keep police on the streets, they need to back welfare reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 23 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.13pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Harman has another go. Will Cameron admit pensioners will be worse off under the budget?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says he recommends the red book. Although in Harman's case, it's the "unread book". It shows the government is spending £1bn on pensioners over the parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harman refers to the table in the red book showing the pension guarantee will cost nothing this year. And she asks Cameron to confirm what he said during the election campaign about families earning up to £40,000 not losing tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says the budget will protect the poor. Child poverty won't go up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harman says he has not answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says she has not addressed the issue of who left the economy in such a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One party put us into this mess. Two parties are working to get us out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Bercow, the Speaker, tells MPs to stop shouting. The public "detest" it, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harman says the public detest broken promises. George Osborne said in his budget statement he would not hide bad news. But he did hide bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says Labour might be adopting "Greekonomics". But the government is sorting out the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 22 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.08pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Harriet Harman asks how much money has been set aside for the pension guarantee, the commitment to uprate pensions in line with inflation, earnings or by 2.5% - whichever is higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says that Labour did not make that commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harman says that Cameron did not answer because no money has been set aside. But the VAT rise will make pensioners worse off, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron says Harman should have listened to his answer. Labour did not restore the earnings link in 13 years. His government has done it in two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 21 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.05pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Cameron starts with a tribute to two soldiers killed in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa Nandy (Labour) asks Cameron for an assurance that he is not seeking to close down coalfields communities again. Cameron insists that he believes in regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Hart (Conservative) asks about support for the territorial army. Cameron says "standing up for our armed forces is not just a government responsibility, it's a social responsibility". Businesses should do their bit, he says (by helping people volunteer for the TA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 20 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; David Cameron is in the Commons chamber now for PMQs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 19 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.59am:&lt;/strong&gt; Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, has just told the BBC's Daily Politics programme that he thinks Lib Dem MPs will support the budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it can be sold. Of course there's unease. There's unease on three fronts. Because none of us - not one single party – wanted to put up VAT. But that has become a choice that was inevitable. Anything that reduces benefits for the vulnerable, or might reduce them, is difficult ... And then the next issue is the spending cuts, where we all have a commitment to make sure that impacts least on the vulnerable and the needy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Lib Dem MP &lt;a href="http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/8233263.Colchester_MP_Bob_Russell_at_loggerheads_with_coalition_over_VAT_increase/"&gt;Bob Russell said that he could not see himself voting for the budget&lt;/a&gt;. But Hughes said Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Steve Webb, the pensions minster, were "very convincing" when they justified the budget to colleagues at a meeting of the parliamentary party last night. Hughes said that he hoped and expected that Lib Dem MPs would vote for the budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 18 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.45am:&lt;/strong&gt; Here are some good blog posts about the budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/2010/06/22/the-budget-factchecked-housing-benefit-child-poverty-and-taxes/"&gt;Cathy Newman at her Channel 4 blog&lt;/a&gt; fact checks Osborne's budget statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2010/06/how-the-conservative-right-won-the-battle-on-the-capital-gains-tax-rate.html"&gt;Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome&lt;/a&gt; explains how Conservative backbenchers won the battle on capital gains tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.leftfootforward.org/2010/06/tory-tax-credit-lies/"&gt;Will Straw at Left Foot Forward says&lt;/a&gt; the budget document has exposed Tory "lies" about their tax credit policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog.php?id=463"&gt;Alastair Campbell praises the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; for revealing that George Osborne's claim about families receiving £104,000 a year in housing benefit is not based on real cases. (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jun/23/budget-housing-benefit-figures-scrutiny"&gt;The Guardian story is here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 17 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.22am:&lt;/strong&gt; Nick Robinson is hosting the BBC's "Britain's economy - Cameron &amp; Clegg Face the Audience" programme tonight (see 9.32am). &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2010/06/what_to_cut.html"&gt;On his blog&lt;/a&gt;, he's asking readers to suggest questions he should ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 16 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.20am:&lt;/strong&gt; What's Gordon Brown been up to since the general election? Watching every single match of the World Cup, &lt;a href="http://waugh.standard.co.uk/2010/06/cameron-to-miss-first-half-of-england-match.html"&gt;according to Paul Waugh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 15 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.05am:&lt;/strong&gt; Peter Walker, energy secretary during the miners' strike and one of the leading "wets" in the Thatcher government, has died. &lt;a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/gazette/2010/06/former-cabinet-minister-lord-walker-of-worcester-has-died.html"&gt;Jonathan Isaby has got more details at ConservativeHome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 14 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.42am:&lt;/strong&gt; The Guardian's budget &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;coverage is all here&lt;/a&gt;. These are some of the best budget articles from the rest of the papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/hamish-mcrae/hamish-mcrae-the-mountain-that-we-all-have-to-climb-just-got-a-little-bit-steeper-2007822.html"&gt;Hamish McRae in the Independent&lt;/a&gt; does not believe all the spending cuts will actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this government, in the final year of its life (assuming it does last the full term) really going to carry on imposing the cuts, the last chunk of those 25% reductions across most departments, when it is just about to face the electorate? I know the Labour plans translated into 20% on the non-protected departments, but 25%? It is not going to happen, is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bdf7380a-7e0d-11df-8478-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=716ef204-6808-11df-af6c-00144feab49a.html"&gt;Martin Wolf in the Financial Times says&lt;/a&gt; George Osborne has taken a huge gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive fiscal tightening was ultimately inevitable. But perhaps only such a young government – in age and in time in office – would gamble so much on such a fast adjustment, so early in its life. As a citizen of the UK, I hope it pulls it off. Maybe, its sense that the UK could not get away with a measured approach is right: we will never know. But this gamble has now defined the government. If it is seen to have failed, it will be finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a00942f4-7e60-11df-94a8-00144feabdc0.html"&gt;Tim Harford in the FT says we're all going to feel the effects of the budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recently taken to dividing budget numbers by 60m, roughly per capita, or by 25m, roughly the number of households in the UK. The effect is bracing: Britain is borrowing £6,000 per household this year. This is, to use a technical macroeconomic term, a fair whack ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next four years we shall see £90bn of tax rises and spending cuts, more than half of which were inherited from Labour. That is £1,500 a year per person or £300 per household per month. We are going to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1288813/EMERGENCY-BUDGET-2010-Masterful-tear-coalition-apart.html"&gt;Peter Oborne in the Daily Mail says&lt;/a&gt; the budget will tear the coalition apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many backbench Liberal Democrats, whose party had been out of power for 70 years before the formation of the coalition government last month, have only ever known the irresponsibility of opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For them, Osborne's rigorous, clear-sighted and deeply responsible budget is a horror story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why, in due course, I believe that this coalition will start to split apart – and that George Osborne's budget can only have brought that moment closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/danielfinkelstein/article2568879.ece"&gt;Daniel Finkelstein in the Times says&lt;/a&gt; that cutting spending won't inevitably make the government unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, there have been two attempts at tracking the relationship between spending and popularity. Both showed that increases in public spending actually reduced votes for the incumbent. And a survey across the OECD found no evidence that looser fiscal policy is related to longer political tenure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this work, [a Goldman Sachs study found] that "the three governments that have executed the most high-profile expenditure-based deficit reductions — Ireland in 1987, Sweden in 1994 and Canada in 1994 — were all of them re-elected".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/budget/7847935/Budget-2010-we-deserved-the-unvarnished-truth-and-Osborne-delivered-it.html"&gt;Benedict Brogan in the Daily Telegraph says&lt;/a&gt; that Osborne has some similarities with Gordon Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would reject the comparison, but in some ways he is like Gordon Brown – political to his fingertips. He calculates for advantage; he delights in the fray. He will have enjoyed telling Labour MPs, for example, that nothing in the budget would make child poverty worse, or that his statement was "progressive".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 13 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.36am:&lt;/strong&gt; I've just finished going through the papers. Generally, Osborne's budget has got a better reception than he might have expected. Here's a rough guide to how the papers are responding to it in their editorials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very positive: The Daily Telegraph, the Times, the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly positive: The Financial Times, the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutral: The Independent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative: The Guardian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very negative: The Daily Mirror&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 12 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.31am:&lt;/strong&gt; Today we'll get the Institute for Fiscal Studies' verdict on the budget. They're holding a briefing at 1pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 11 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.09am:&lt;/strong&gt; MPs are going to have to start paying more for their food and drink in the Commons. The Commons Commission, which runs the place, has just put out a press release saying that it has decided to cut the budget for the Commons by £12m for 2010-11, nearly 5% more than originally planned. The Commons budget will now be £219m this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial savings will be made in various ways including: by scaling back a number of programmes and projects, reducing the parliamentary works programme and freezing all but essential recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year £800,000 will be cut from the budget for select committee travel, and to save a further £500,000 catering prices across the house will be raised. This will bring cafeteria prices into line with benchmark workplace venues and bar prices into line with a competitively-priced high street pub chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More detailed consideration of further reductions in the catering subsidy will be part of a savings programme set up to identify and achieve additional budget reductions over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was inevitable with David Cameron now running the country. Last year &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/sep/08/cameron-cut-ministers-salaries"&gt;Cameron gave a speech&lt;/a&gt; saying that MPs should no longer have their food and drink subsidised by the taxpayer. He was particulary angry about the fact that MPs could get a "lean salad of lemon and lime-marinated roasted tofu with baby spinach and rocket, home-roasted plum tomatoes and grilled ficelle crouton" for just £1.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not any more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 10 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.32am:&lt;/strong&gt; More about the Cameron/Clegg joint TV appearance tonight (see 8.30am). It will be shown on BBC News at 7pm, and then it will be repeated on BBC 2 at 11.25pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 9 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.15am:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to know more about what the budget says about where the government is going to gets its money, and what it's going to spend it on, my colleague Paddy Allen has produced &lt;a href="http://www.guprod.gnl/uk/interactive/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-state-britain-finances"&gt;a wonderful interactive graphic revealing the state of Britain's finances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 8 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.55am:&lt;/strong&gt; Alistair Darling has also been giving interviews this morning. This is what he told the Today programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm very concerned, and I'm not the only one - there are a number of commentators and others who are extremely concerned that this government is taking a risk. This is not pain-free. Get this wrong and the consequences could be dire for many, many people and businesses in this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, they announced a whole screed of stuff yesterday and, as the days go by, I suspect some of the small print will reveal one or two horrors that aren't immediately obvious. But also, with a coalition government and a flaky set of partners like the Liberal Democrats, I just wonder whether they will be able to deliver some of this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 7 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.54am:&lt;/strong&gt; Osborne has also been doing television interviews this morning. From what I've read about them on the Press Association wire, it doesn't look as if he said anything original. But it sounds as if the GMTV interview was quite lively. This is from the PA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osborne, who looked stony-faced as he was played angry and anxious messages from GMTV viewers about his budget announcements, defended the decision to freeze child benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't want to get rid of it. Some people were telling me 'abolish child benefit'," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I care about helping mothers who receive that benefit. For many people it's the one thing they get without asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of abolishing it I've frozen it, which keeps child benefit, and means hopefully in a couple of years' time we'll be able to increase it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can watch the footage of it on the &lt;a href="http://www.gm.tv/videos/?vxClipId=1441_gmtv_9334"&gt;GMTV website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 6 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.43am:&lt;/strong&gt; It wasn't one of the all-time great interviews. But there were four points that stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Osborne suggested that welfare cuts could go even deeper.&lt;/strong&gt; He said that if further money can be saved from the welfare budget, then the spending cuts in other areas won't have to be so severe. He made this point when he was asked how the Home Office could cut spending by 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be 25%, in the sense that if over the coming couple of months we can find further savings in the welfare budget, then we can bring that 25% number down. In the end that is the trade-off we've got to make in the spending review, not just between departments, but also between the very large welfare bill and the departmental expenditure bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne is already committed to cutting welfare spending by £11bn. It's hard to see how he could win political support (especially from the Lib Dems) for even deeper cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;He said there would be a "big public engagement" about the spending review&lt;/strong&gt;. Cameron and Clegg are expected to say more about that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Osborne insisted that the Tories were not planning a VAT increase before the election&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;He claimed that being part of a coalition had "enormously" strengthened his hand as chancellor because it meant there was a democratic mandate for what he was doing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 5 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.30am:&lt;/strong&gt; David Cameron and Nick Clegg are due to make a joint television appearance together today to discuss the budget. Nick Robinson has just told the Today programme that he will be doing the interviewing. Apparently he will be chairing a Q&amp;A type event. It's due to take place some time late this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 4 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.27am:&lt;/strong&gt; Davis and Osborne are still talking about spending cuts. Osborne says that David Cameron and Nick Clegg will be saying more today about how the public will be engaged in this debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis asks about the election. He says the debate about spending was not conducted in an honest way. Why couldn't politicians discuss cuts honestly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says he doesn't agree. The issue of spending cuts did come up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: But what about VAT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says the issue of whether of not the government needed to go faster in cutting spending was aired during the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On taxation, Osborne says the Tories were not planning seven or eight weeks ago to go ahead with a VAT rise. They only decided to implement this rise when they saw the borrowing figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis says the figures were reasonably well known before the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne repeats the point about the need for more immediate cuts being a central issue in the election. Having two parties working together has strengthened his hand as chancellor, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it. I'll sum up in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 3 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.22am:&lt;/strong&gt; Evan Davis asks about the balance between tax rises and spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says that international studies have shown that, where the bulk of the work is done by spending cuts, deficit reduction programmes tend to be more successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: But you could have put taxes up more to avoid spending cuts. Why did you want to shrink the state to below 40% of GDP?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says that is not being done for "ideological reasons". He is taking spending down to average levels. He could have increased taxes more. But that would have posed a risk to the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: But aren't spending cuts a risk to the economy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says he needed to tackle the root cause of the problem, "a decade of over-spending".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: The Home Office budget is £10bn. How are you going to cut it by 25%?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says the spending review will be a "real challenge".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he inherited a situation where there were going to be 20% reductions anyway under Labour's plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, he decided to tell the public by how much departmental budgets would be cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, if the government can find more welfare savings, then other budgets won't have to be cut by 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Will you slash entire programmes? Or will you salami slice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both, says Osborne. In some cases the government will look at what functions the state is performing and ask if those are necessary. He mentions the child trust fund as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 2 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.14am:&lt;/strong&gt; Evan Davis is interviewing George Osborne. He says that Osborne's policies will take state spending as a share of GDP to below the level it was in the Thatcher years. Has Osborne gone too far?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says Britain needs to live within its means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: But is this is a political project? It's as if you want to cut spending for political reasons, now, while you can get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne says his plan is credible. He says that he needed to announce deep cuts because he needed to act with "caution". He needed to plan for the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 1 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.00am:&lt;/strong&gt; What does Britain make of the budget? That's the question that is going to dominate the day. I'll be looking at the papers properly later, but here are three verdicts from today's Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-conservatives-liberal-democrat"&gt;Polly Toynbee says&lt;/a&gt; it was a Tory budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a Tory budget, a very Tory budget, with only a little Lib Dem icing. All its headlines flashed out Tory policies of the past: on their watch unfair VAT always rises, fair income tax never does. To take only 23% from taxes with 77% in cuts ordains that the pain will fall on the poorest people in the poorest regions most dependent on public spending and the rollcall of familiar blighted zones will grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-the-axeman-cometh-analysis"&gt;Larry Elliott says&lt;/a&gt; it was "brutal stuff".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat your heart out Geoffrey Howe. Take a back seat Norman Lamont. Austerity has a new champion and his name is George Osborne. Today's budget was billed as tough but that failed to do justice to a package that made Sir Stafford Cripps look like a soft touch. Not content with the £73bn of tax increases and spending cuts inherited from Alistair Darling, Osborne added an extra £40bn of tightening of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/22/budget-poor-fairness-osborne"&gt;And Jonathan Freedland says&lt;/a&gt; it will hit the poorest hardest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Osborne now feels obliged to speak of fairness, to appear to be whacking the banks and shielding the poorest children in the land; but these are moves born, above all, of presentation and political calculation. Look closely and you see that this is by no means the "progressive budget" the chancellor claimed. It does not pay more than superficial deference to the terms of trade laid down by the last government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cameron will have his chance to defend the budget at prime minister's questions. I'll be covering that, plus all the other reaction to the budget. But first we've got George Osborne talking about it on the Today programme at 8.10am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/pmqs"&gt;PMQs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending"&gt;Tax and spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewsparrow"&gt;Andrew Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

He is one of many federal judges across the Gulf Coast region with money in oil and gas. Several have disqualified themselves from hearing spill-related claims, while others have sold their holdings so they can preside over many cases being filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josh Reichert, managing director of the Pew Environment Group, said the ruling should be rescinded if he still held  such shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Judge Feldman has any investments in oil and gas operators in the Gulf, it represents a flagrant conflict of interest," Reichert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least two major oil companies, Shell and Marathon, said they would wait for the appeal before resuming drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/oil"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bp-oil-spill"&gt;BP oil spill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oilandgascompanies"&gt;Oil and gas companies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/oil-spills"&gt;Oil spills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oil"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bp"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/pollution"&gt;Pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matthewweaver"&gt;Matthew Weaver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

"People might blame Cameron and break the ConDem coalition and bring forward the impending election. GO SLOVENIA!" Given England's capitulation to West Germany in the 1970 quarter finals is supposed to have done for Harold Wilson in the election four days later, ushering in the Ted Heath era, there may be something in this. Go Slovenia, then? Anyone? Hello?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 14 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What England need to do:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ER6p8mPuVU"&gt;Get the battle fever on.&lt;/a&gt; "Is England's promise to be 'aggressive' and 'press' a lot code for the battle fever?" wonders Greig Aitken, raising the possibility that Fabio Capello and the late, great Jock Wallace have more in common than was previously thought. "But is the battle fever enough for this bunch of charlies?" wonders Greig. "Mightn't they overdo the battle fever? One recalls Kevin Keegam's invocation to 'go out and drop a few bombs' some time ago - and Paul Scholes got himself sent off inside half an hour. The application of the battle fever is a complicated business, and probably requires a physio called Archie doing some ornate - quite possibly Masonic - hand contortions on taught hamstrings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 13 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now England, much as we thought:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-David James; 2-Glen Johnson, 15-Matthew Upson, 6-John Terry, 3-Ashley Cole; 16-James Milner, 4-Steven Gerrard, 8-Frank Lampard, 14-Gareth Barry; 19-Jermain Defoe, 10-Wayne Rooney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 12 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, the teams are in. Slovenia first:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-Samir Handanovic; 2-Miso Brecko, 4-Marko Suler, 5-Bostjan Cesar, 13-Bojan Jokic; 10-Valter Birsa, 8-Robert Koren, 18-Aleksandar Radosavljevic, 17-Andraz Kirm; 9-Zlatan Ljubijankic, 11-Milivoje Novakovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 11 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, there's another team playing today, by the way.&lt;/strong&gt; The Slovenes only let in four goals during qualifying, put Guus Hiddink and Andriy Arshavin's Russia out in the play-offs, in Valter Birsa and Robert Koren can boast two of the tournament's standout players so far, and in 25-year-old Udinese star Samir Handanovic have one of the most promising goalkeepers in the world. "We are a confident, courageous side and we will be able to face up to England," insists their quietly-spoken coach Matjaz Kek. Slovenia only need a point to make sure of qualification; England of course need to win. It is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 10 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man with red cards in his pocket, ready to go:&lt;/strong&gt; Wolfgang Stark (Germany)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 9 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England promise to:&lt;/strong&gt; Be "aggressive" and "press" a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 8 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of the nation:&lt;/strong&gt; Party mode. It's a small sample, consisting of the folk on the train to Kings Cross this lunchtime, but your MBM correspondent saw: several gentlemen swilling from cans of San Miguel and talking excitedly about the World Cup; two blonde women in frankly disorienting 1980s style football shorts waving flags; and a bloke sitting on his own necking a tin of pre-mixed gin and tonic. The latter at least has to be an England supporter. Whatever, it's clear England has decided to party, just in case this turns out to have been the last chance for another four years, the country slipping into Insoucient Scotland mode from tomorrow onwards. Looking forward to the journey home, I can tell you that for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 7 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stadium:&lt;/strong&gt; Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 6 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kick off:&lt;/strong&gt; 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 5 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons to be manically depressed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. England are not Italy under Enzo Bearzot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 4 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons to be cheerful ahead of today's game:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. England were bloody awful in the first two games at the 1986 World Cup - as anyone who hears the name Carlos Manuel and shudders will attest - but came good in the third match. They went on to the quarters, where they were the thickness of Gary Lineker's wig away from equalising against a rocking Argentina and surely going on to win the title.&lt;br /&gt;2. Ditto 1990, where they didn't get started until the &lt;em&gt;final minute&lt;/em&gt; of their &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; game, the second-round match against Belgium. And look what happened after that.&lt;br /&gt;3. Perhaps the most famous false start in a World Cup was made by Italy in 1982, striker Paolo Rossi barely capable of passing the ball to team-mates five yards away in the first round, never mind scoring. Enzo Bearzot's side hit form in the second phase and went on to win Espana 82, allowing the manager showcasing a swanky white blazer in the final. &lt;a href="http://www.repubblica.it/2006/07/speciale/mondiali/servizi/vincere-a-mente-fredda/vincere-a-mente-fredda/ansa_8454458_32400.jpg"&gt;It really was a swanky blazer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Whatever happens today, despite their manifold faults, England are not France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 3 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never mind. JT's still likely to be in the team, which is rumoured to be:&lt;/strong&gt; James; Johnson, Poor Man's Gary Neville, Upson, A Cole; Barry; Milner, Lampard, Gerrard; Rooney, Defoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 2 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this time, JT aligns himself with the working classes, positioning himself as an industrial agitator.&lt;/strong&gt; Sadly, this sort of thing doesn't play so well at the moment, not even in France. The country has has lurched violently to the right, so much so that the likes of David Cameron and even Nick Clegg have been elected into power. In any case, the Brits are a notoriously lily-livered shower when it comes to workplace politics, too craven to strike – [note to non-British readers: we're a sorry servile bunch, we don't like it up us] - and as a result, poor John's failed coup has led to him becoming the most reviled union leader in British history, ahead of the excellent Bob Crow, the much misunderstood Arthur Scargill, and Gary Neville. Poor JT! And Joe Cole's &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; likely to be on the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 1 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome! So it's come to this. But you have to feel sorry for poor old JT. He was only trying to make the people happy.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider: last time round, the players and Wags were swanning around boutiques in Baden-Baden, laden with bungalow-sized shopping bags, like it was 1967 on the Kings Raahd all over again. Peter Crouch, meanwhile, had &lt;a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/minbymin/0,,1788265,00.html"&gt;turned into Andrew Ridgeley circa 1984&lt;/a&gt;. It was quite the scene, the decadent Last Days all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010"&gt;World Cup 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/world-cup-2010-group-c"&gt;World Cup 2010 Group C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/scottmurray"&gt;Scott Murray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

His family has been told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel James Carr-Smith, spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said: "He was on a security patrol, helping to better the lives of ordinary Afghans, when he was killed by small arms fire from insurgent forces. His courage in the face of danger and his selfless commitment will not be forgotten. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him. We will remember him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of British dead since the conflict began in 2001 now stands at 303.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family and colleagues today paid tribute to Paul Warren, a Royal Marine who was killed in Afghanistan on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 23-year-old from Leyland, Lancashire, was one of three servicemen from 40 Commando Royal Marines to die in three days, all in Helmand. He was caught in an explosion during a patrol in Sangin and died from his injuries. His family said in a statement that he was  "a loving son, a brother and grandson who made us proud as a family. His cheeky smile will be missed by all who knew him".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren, who was born in Preston, joined the Royal Marines in 2006. He served with 45 Commando in Afghanistan in 2008-9 and was deployed again in March as part of Charlie company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MoD said Charlie company was responsible for security around patrol base Airport Lounge and had conducted dozens of patrols in support of the local population. The company completed numerous joint clearance operations with Afghan national security forces and uncovered many improvised explosive devices, making the area safer for local people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Ed Moorhouse, commanding officer of Charlie company,  said: "Marine Paul Warren was something special in Charlie company, and that is an accolade I use sparingly in the close-knit band of brothers that we are, where all excel in doing their duty in the most challenging of environments in Sangin. In singling out Marine Paul Warren, this accolade rightly describes a man who volunteered and acted as point man for every patrol which his section undertook in Sangin; in my eyes these men, on point, are the bravest of the brave."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, the father of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jun/22/300th-soldier-richard-hollington-tributes" title=""&gt;the 300th soldier to be killed in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; said he wanted a personal explanation from the prime minister as to why Britain was fighting the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Hollington, father of Royal Marine Richard Hollington, told ITV News: "I do not see a huge amount of progress being made and it would be extremely interesting to hear from Mr [David] Cameron or Mr [Liam] Fox [the defence secretary] exactly why we are there because I don't think the public are being told enough to justify what is going on at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollington, who described his 23-year-old son as a lion, said he did not think soldiers in Afghanistan were fighting for Queen and country, but for each other. "They are doing it because, by looking after each other, they have the best chance of coming back alive," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, of whom 8,000 are based in Helmand, the country's most dangerous province. Since becoming prime minister, Cameron has said that British forces will not remain in Afghanistan "a day longer than is necessary".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liamfox"&gt;Liam Fox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktran"&gt;Mark Tran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

However, he was then a senior minister at the Ministry of Agriculture and was later energy secretary for a spell that included the bitterly divisive miners' strike of 1984-85. His last three years in the cabinet were spent as secretary of state for Wales between 1987 and 1990. He was made a peer after he left the Commons in 1992. His son Robin was elected MP for Worcester for the Tories in last month's general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He leaves his wife Tessa, five children and five grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

But Andrew Sentance voted for a hike to 0.75%, citing "resilient" inflation and recovering demand, according to minutes of the meeting released today. It was the first time anyone on the MPC had voted for a hike since August 2008 - before the Lehman Brothers collapse and ensuing global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other members, however, thought that changes to the balance of risks were "insufficient" to warrant raising rates so soon. They also wanted to wait to see the full "nature and scope" of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-vat-austerity-plan" title=""&gt;George Osborne's budget on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, which in the event was the toughest in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news of a split caught financial markets off guard even though Sentance was a known hawk on the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a major surprise within the Bank of England minutes," said James Knightley at ING Financial Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he kept his forecast for rates to remain low as inflation eases, especially in the context of yesterday's budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With significant public sector job losses likely there is the risk that a lack of vigour in the private sector means unemployment will continue to rise. This will limit the chance of second round price effects through higher wage demands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several months of inflation well above the BoE's 2% government-set target, Sentance thought a pattern was emerging. According to the minutes, he believed that: "Inflation had proved resilient in the aftermath of the recession, casting doubt on the future dampening impact of spare capacity on inflation. Demand had recovered at home and abroad, and the average growth of the main measures of UK nominal demand in recent quarters had been above typical pre-recession rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pound strengthened against the dollar and euro on the news of a split at the BoE while government bond futures pared earlier gains as traders scaled back bets that rates will remain low for many months to come. There was further support for the pound in the news some other members also thought that the balance of risks to inflation had moved to the upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, economists focused on the fact most of the committee - currently down by one member while a replacement for Kate Barker is sought - remained of the view it was too early to withdraw stimuli to the nascent recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"News since the meeting should have calmed inflation nerves somewhat. For a start, CPI inflation itself fell from 3.7% to 3.4% in May. Meanwhile, the fact that the VAT rise is delayed until next year avoids a further spike in inflation in the near-term, and hence reduces the risk of a rise in inflation expectations. And lastly, the large tightening in the budget will, other things equal, pull down the MPC's inflation forecast," said Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, it's obviously a testing time for the committee – but for now, most members appear to be holding their nerve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/interest-rates"&gt;Interest rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/inflation"&gt;Inflation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

It's a ritual locals will be more than used to after 40 years (give or take a few fallow periods) of what has become the biggest outdoor festival in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this year's festival offers something that has been largely absent in recent years – sunny skies. The Met Office is upholding its prediction that Glastonbury will enjoy temperatures in the mid-20s and largely dry, sunny spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Met Office's Helen Chivers warned that there may still be the need for wellies: "Although the weather looks fine – dry and sunny for most of the weekend – there is a possibility of thundery showers on Sunday in Somerset. It's pot luck as to whether this will reach the festival itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Eavis, who's been at the helm of Glastonbury since 1970, told the Guardian: "We've had nearly three weeks of unbroken good weather, so the site is looking spotless. Honestly, it's like a cricket pitch out there, with all the players getting into place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People seem to be coming earlier every year because the ticket price has risen, so they want their money's worth. That's great for us, it makes the transition into the festival smoother and we want people to have value for money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eavis said he enjoyed a moment of calm before the festival in the early hours of Monday morning (21 June) for the summer solstice. "We popped up to the stone circle at 4am and had our little hippy-dippy moment. It was lovely. But now it's on to the serious stuff: there are a lot of people and cars to organise out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Glastonbury spokesman Jason Holmes said that almost 15,000 vehicles had already arrived on site and that "excitement levels are high" ahead of the England v Slovenia match this afternoon. The festival will be showing the match live on the Pyramid stage from 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glastonbury opens today and will close on Sunday night (27 June). Gorillaz, Muse and Stevie Wonder will headline the Pyramid stage over the weekend. And should today's football result go in England's favour, the next match will be shown in a field set aside for 30,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian is the official media sponsor of Glastonbury festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/glastonbury"&gt;Glastonbury festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weather/glastonbury"&gt;Glastonbury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rosieswash"&gt;Rosie Swash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.4/29682?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Dallas+police+chief%27s+grief+after+his+son+kills+policeman+and+young+fath%3AArticle%3A1416830&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=US+news%2CGun+crime+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=James+Meikle&amp;c7=10-Jun-23&amp;c8=1416830&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FUnited+States" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;David Brown, whose son was shot by police after gunning down two people in Texas, tells of deep hurt at three deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new police chief of Dallas said he could not "adequately express" his sadness after his son shot an officer and a passer-by in separate incidents before being gunned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cbs11tv.com/local/david.brown.dallas.2.1674767.html" title=""&gt;David Brown, sworn in &lt;/a&gt;seven weeks ago told his 3,600-member department last night: "The past few days have been very troubling and emotional for all of us. My family has not only lost a son, but a fellow police officer and a private citizen lost their lives at the hands of our son. That hurts so deeply I cannot adequately express the sadness I feel inside my heart."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators say Brown's 27-year-old son, also called David, killed a 37-year-old police officer in the Texas city's suburb of Lancaster on Sunday, minutes after he fatally shot another man in a random attack. &lt;a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/crime/stories/062310dnmetbrownstatement.cba5c665.html" title=""&gt;According to local media reports&lt;/a&gt;, officer Craig Shaw, who died in hospital, was responding to the first shooting. Jeremy McMillian, 23, died as he was driving his girlfriend and two children through an apartment complex. Officers are said to have shot Brown more than a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Rathburn, who was Dallas police chief from 1991-93, said: "This, in my opinion, is the worst possible personal tragedy any chief of police could have." Brown senior said in his statement that he had offered condolences to the families of both victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaQuita Spence, McMillian's girlfriend, told the Dallas Morning News, she did not blame the police chief for his son's crimes. "Honestly, I don't fault his father because the guy was a grown man and he took his actions upon himself. I think his dad raised him until he was 18. He did his father part. The guy, he chose to do what he wanted to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had earlier &lt;a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/yahoolatestnews/stories/062210dnmetlanshooting.1e4e7a4.html" title=""&gt;told the News about Brown's attack&lt;/a&gt;. "He just put the gun to the window and opened fire ... He just had a terrifying look. His eyes were big; they were kind of glossy." The two men did not know each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas city manager Mary Suhm, who hired Brown, 49, to be police chief, said in a statement: "What we are dealing with is an unimaginable tragedy affecting three families in two communities. We have a great deal of experience, depth and leadership in the Dallas police department that can back up the command staff in Chief Brown's absence or during any crisis the department may face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear when Brown, said to be a private man, might return to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His son has a minor criminal record, having pleaded no contest to an incident involving marijuana in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The younger Brown's girlfriend, Misty Conaway, called Lancaster police to their apartment on Sunday morning, seven hours before the shootings, according to 911 tapes released to the media. She said Brown was having "a psychotic breakdown" and had hit her. Conaway did not file a formal complaint, but she and her children were taken to the police station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suzie Sawyer, executive director of &lt;a href="http://www.nationalcops.org/" title=""&gt;Concerns of Police Survivors&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation that helps families and agencies cope with the death of an officer, called the shootings a horrible family tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brotherhood and sisterhood in law enforcement is extremely tight," she said. "There will be hundreds of questions about this forever. You never expect another cop's child to take the life of an officer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime"&gt;Gun crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/22/immigration-nebraska-vote-banish-illegals</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.4/92992?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Nebraska+town+bars+illegal+immigrants+from+jobs+and+renting+property%3AArticle%3A1416523&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=US+news%2CWorld+news%2CLaw&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Ed+Pilkington&amp;c7=10-Jun-22&amp;c8=1416523&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FUnited+States" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Fremont in Nebraska has passed laws meaning illegal immigrants cannot work or rent property within its boundaries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small town in the pig-farming and cattle rearing great plains of Nebraska has opened the latest frontline in the battle over immigration by voting effectively to banish all illegal immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under ordinance 5165, which passed in a special election  yesterday, undocumented immigrants in Fremont will lose the right to rent homes and take up jobs. A new system of licences for property and business will be introduced to catch out those without proper resident status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure was passed on a turn-out of 45% of the population, with 3,906 in favour and 2,908 against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremont has relatively few immigrants: in a 2008 census, 4.4% of its 25,000 population were recorded as foreign born, compared with the national figure of 12.6%. Most are Hispanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in favour of the ban argued that lack of action by the federal government meant the community had to act on its own. Scott Getzschman, a local councillor, told the &lt;a href="http://fremonttribune.com/article_abf359d6-7d86-11df-928c-001cc4c002e0.html" title="Fremont Tribune"&gt;Fremont Tribune&lt;/a&gt;: "People are fed up with the fact that the federal government will not take this issue head on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opponents said that voters had been influenced by a mood of hostility towards immigrants that was sweeping America. Krista Kjeldgaard, a member of  &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/onefremontonefuture/" title="One Fremont — One Future"&gt;One Fremont – One Future&lt;/a&gt;, said: "Nationally, there's been a lot of hoop-la and a lot of rhetoric used over immigration. It feeds off people's fears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its campaigning, One Fremont warned the town that if it passed the measure it would pay heavily. Other small towns across the US that have passed similar laws, such as Hazelton in Pennsylvania and Farmers Branch in Texas, have had to spend up to $5m (£3.36m) in lawyers' fees after the new rules were thrown out as unconstitutional by the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremont council is braced for an increase in property taxes and possible cuts in public services to cover the cost of defending the ordinance against challenges. The American Civil Liberties Union has already announced it intends to oppose the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fremont move is just the latest in a spate of community efforts to restrict immigration, the most extreme of which is a state-wide law in Arizona that starts at the end of July requiring police to check the identification of anyone they suspect of being an illegal immigrant. The Obama administration is expected to file a lawsuit against the law next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington"&gt;Ed Pilkington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.4/45952?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Jamaican+gang+boss+arrested+on+way+to+American+embassy%3AArticle%3A1416675&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Jamaica+%28News%29%2CGangs+%28Society%29%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news%2CChristopher+Dudus+Coke&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CCommunities+Society%2CCentral+America+and+Caribbean+Travel&amp;c6=Chris+McGreal&amp;c7=10-Jun-23&amp;c8=1416675&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FJamaica" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;'Dudus' Coke appears to have wanted to surrender to US officials out of safety concerns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jamaican police have captured the once powerful gang leader, Christopher "Dudus" Coke, as he was on his way to surrender to the US embassy in Kingston weeks after leading a bloody urban battle to avoid deportation for trial to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke appears to have wanted to hand himself in to the Americans out of concern for his safety after his father died in a mysterious prison cell fire that some Jamaicans believe was intended to prevent him talking in court about the close links between the island's criminal gangs and leading politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authorities declared a curfew in large parts of Kingston after warning that further violence by Coke's powerful Shower Posse gang was "expected imminently" following their leader's arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, Coke, 42, who was described as the "don of criminal dons" and until recently widely regarded as the most powerful man in Jamaica, was being held in a police station near Kingston that was heavily fortified by police guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police commissioner, Owen Ellington, said Coke was arrested at a roadblock after the authorities received intelligence about his movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a local evangelical clergyman, Al Miller, told a Jamaican radio station he had been accompanying Coke to the US embassy after arranging his surrender to the Americans when they were stopped by the police and recognised. Miller helped Coke's brother, Leighton "Livity" Coke, hand himself in to the authorities earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police said they were keen to question Miller about his contacts with Coke while he was on the run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said that Coke would not fight his extradition to New York to face trial on drug and weapons trafficking charges. The Americans allege that Coke heads a criminal empire stretching from Jamaica to Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear if the US authorities had agreed to accept Coke's surrender or if they even knew he was coming. One possibility is that the Americans tipped off the Jamaican police as it is likely that the embassy would have had to have handed him over in order for the formal extradition procedures to be followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ellington said that Coke could face charges locally first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 76 people were killed during four days of violence in the Kingston neighbourhood of Tivoli Gardens three weeks ago where Coke and his gang were supported by many residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Jamaican government said it would extradite Coke, his gangs attacked police stations. The assault prompted the declaration of a state of emergency in the capital and the biggest security force mobilisation in Jamaica's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of soldiers and much of Kingston's police force were brought in as the military swept in to Tivoli Gardens in search of Coke. He and his men fled after a day of fighting. But the violence went on as the military and police swept through the neighbourhood, rounding up men and, according to witnesses, summarily killing some of those they detained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people were trapped in the areas of fighting. Streets in most of the rest of Kingston were abandoned for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many residents of Tivoli Gardens said they did not want to see Coke captured because his gang had provided money and assistance for necessities such as education and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other Jamaicans supported the move against Coke because his and other gangs were viewed as having grown to powerful and as having corrupted politics for too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamaica's prime minister, Bruce Golding, recently pledged to sever the ties between the gangs and political parties and to break the grip of the criminal "dons" on whole communities and large parts of the economy. But political leaders have acknowledged that will not be possible without a significant shift in resources to uplift the poorest Jamaicans. Until then, with Jamaica sitting as a stopover on the hugely profitable drug smuggling route between Latin America and the US, Coke's arrest is not likely to put an end to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gangs"&gt;Gangs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christopher-dudus-coke"&gt;Christopher 'Dudus' Coke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chrismcgreal"&gt;Chris McGreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

It warned Belarus it would eventually cut the deliveries by 85% if it refuses to pay off its debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus' energy ministry has warned in a letter to the European commission that cuts of more than 15% could lead to transit shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said Wednesday that transit of Russian gas to European customers has so far continued uninterrupted despite the Belarussian threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom has insisted that European customers will not be affected by the shut-off as the company can reroute gas supplies through another transit pipeline crossing Ukraine. About 80% of Russian gas exported to Europe normally goes through Ukraine, while the rest is carried via Belarusian pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has cut gas supplies to both Ukraine and Belarus several times in recent years due to payment disputes, and many European consumers have suffered amid freezing winter temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is Belarus's main ally and sponsor, but relations between the two former Soviet countries have been strained by financial arguments. Belarus has insisted that Russia should provide cheaper oil and gas as part of the customs union deal that is to come into force next month, but Russia has refused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus has refused to pay a higher gas price this year and insisted that Russia owes it $260m in transit fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/gas"&gt;Gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

The balance of -5% was better than May's surprisingly weak -18% and beat retailers' own expectations, but was still below economists' predictions for a return to growth at +5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBI said there were hopes of at least a limited rebound on the back of the World Cup and as shoppers hurry to make big purchases before a VAT hike in January. But mostly, retailers expected sales growth to be muted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main blow to business in early June came from slack demand for footwear and leather goods while there was also a drag from hardware, china and DIY. On the upside, shops reported buoyant sales of food, drinks and TVs as households got ready for the World Cup. The survey was conducted between 27 May and 9 June, just before the football finals kicked off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers are optimistic the World Cup effect will continue in July and a balance of 11% of firms expect volumes to be up on a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Retailers are hopeful that sales will strengthen next month. As the survey pre-dates the emergency budget, news that the feared rise in VAT will not take effect until next January may well also encourage some advance spending over the second half of the year," said Ian McCafferty, CBI chief economic adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jun/22/vat-tax-rise-george-osborne" title=""&gt;VAT rise to 20% from 17.5% announced in the budget&lt;/a&gt; will not take effect until next January, the British Retail Consortium said it will costs jobs and ramp up inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists predict that retailers will face pressures on the high street even sooner thanks to the budget's raft of spending cuts and tax hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The overall outlook for consumer spending still looks pretty weak. Rising taxes, frozen or falling benefit payments and falls in the public sector pay bill will all squeeze household incomes severely," said Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/retail"&gt;Retail industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/katieallen"&gt;Katie Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Is it all over for Tom Cruise?</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/jun/23/tom-cruise-knight-and-day</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.4/65656?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=They+think+it%27s+all+over+for+Tom+Cruise%3F+Is+it%3F+%7C+Ben+Child+%3AArticle%3A1416807&amp;ch=Film&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Tom+Cruise+%28Film%29%2CFilm%2CAction+and+adventure+%28Film+genre%29%2CCulture+section&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CFilm+Reviews&amp;c6=Ben+Child&amp;c7=10-Jun-23&amp;c8=1416807&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Blogpost&amp;c11=Film&amp;c13=&amp;c25=Film+blog&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FFilm%2FTom+Cruise" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Knight and Day may be taking a pummelling but have reports of the death of the sofa-jumper's career been, once again, greatly exaggerated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Cruise has been written off more times than the English football team, so perhaps we shouldn't be too concerned by the &lt;a href="http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/64867,people,news,all-over-for-tom-cruise-as-new-action-comedy-flops" title="brickbats currently being thrown"&gt;brickbats currently being thrown&lt;/a&gt; at new comedy thriller Knight and Day, in which he co-stars with Cameron Diaz. The film has certainly picked up a few snotty reviews in the US, where it arrives this weekend, but this is an actor who managed to survive the twin horrors of ill-judged second world war tale Valkyrie and tedious thinkpiece Lions For Lambs, so suggestions that his career is dead in the water may be a little premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US gossip writer Perez Hilton has &lt;a href="http://perezhilton.com/2010-06-21-tom-cruise-is-killing-his-own-movie" title="gone so far as to hint"&gt;gone so far as to hint&lt;/a&gt; that studio bosses designed the poster for Knight and Day to hide the actor's face, so convinced are they that he lacks popularity. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/aug/23/usa.world" title="epiphany apparently experienced by Paramount boss Sumner Redstone"&gt;Paramount boss Sumner Redstone&lt;/a&gt; gave the actor his thumbs-down a few years ago when he cut the studio's 14-year tie with Cruise amid concerns about his off-screen conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knight and Day sees Cruise as a mysterious action man who crash-lands in Diaz's life, claiming to be a rogue CIA agent. The storyline sees the pair careering around the world as they are chased by US secret service types, Spanish drug dealers and German assassins. The film is described by the New York Post's Lou Lumenick as a "big, dumb summer movie with no apparent ambition" and "an ultra-predictable plot that seems to have been cranked out by a computer screenwriting program without significant human input". Variety's Justin Chang berates "a high-energy, low-impact caper-comedy" and The Seattle Times's Moira Macdonald suggests it is little more than "a computer-generated assortment of random Hollywood action-movie scenes shuffled together".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk is that Cruise &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-cruise-20100619,0,6083180.story" title="took just $11m (£7.4m) to star"&gt;took just $11m (£7.4m) to star&lt;/a&gt;, rather than his usual $20m cut, and has foregone a share of the profits. Could Knight and Day really be the movie that sees him finally fall off his A-list perch? It's certainly the case that this is exactly the kind of breezy, cheesy mainstream fare that would have been utterly critic-proof just a few years ago, but has all the sofa-jumping and scientology spouting turned off moviegoers? Or is action Cruise just a bit past it at 47? We'll find out what the score is when the film arrives in the UK on August 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/tomcruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/actionandadventure"&gt;Action and adventure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/benchild"&gt;Ben Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

The main channel's loss widened from £9.9m in 2008 to £61.6m last year, according to Channel 4's annual report for 2009, published today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Channel 4's digital TV services – E4, Film4, More4 and 4Music – helped the broadcaster weather last year's recession, increasing revenues by 4% year on year to £181.3m. This helped deliver a 43% year-on-year rise in digital TV profits to £53.4m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channel 4's Future Media division also made a positive financial contribution, turning in a pre-tax profit of £3m, compared with a £7.3m loss in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues for the online business were down 2% year on year to £32.8m, but Channel 4 said "savings on platform costs" helped the division deliver a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decline in online display advertising was also offset by improved revenues from video-on-demand service 4oD, which saw a 60% year-on-year increase in full-length programme views to 218m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channel 4's overall turnover declined 8% year on year to £830.3m. Profit was down from £1.8m in 2008, to £300,000 last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster also cut costs on continuing operations by 8% – £68.2m – year-on-year to £778.7m. This included an 8% – £50.3m – cut in the 2009 programming and content budget to £548.3m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a redundancy programme in the final three months of 2008, Channel 4's average monthly headcount was down 23% year on year to 696, contributing to an £8.7m cut in employment costs in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Bulford, Channel 4 group finance director, who was acting chief executive from October 2009 to the start of May 2010, said: "These results clearly demonstrate the value of Channel 4's long-term investment in making our content available digitally and the tight controls we have exercised over costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Abraham, who took over as chief executive last month, added: "It's a credit to everyone working here that Channel 4 has come through such a sharp downturn with our share of advertising revenues and ratings and our cash reserves intact and that we've continued to deliver creative excellence despite having significantly less money to spend on content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have created a stable financial base that allows us to commit with confidence to a fresh round of creative and commercial innovation, renewing Channel 4's schedules post Big Brother and positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that arise from the ongoing convergence of television and other media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Maybe that statement is too sophisticated for some, but it shouldn't be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Glenn Beck, the conservative Fox News host and popular US talk radio presenter, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/13/glenn-beck-fox-news" title="portrayed Strong"&gt;portrayed Strong&lt;/a&gt; as a malevolent figure using his UN contacts to bring about the "collapse" of the world's "industrialised civilisations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beck said: "[Strong is] involved in collapsing the global economies into the hands of a global government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Lord Monckton, the prominent climate sceptic who &lt;a href="http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/1666-lord-monckton-is-new-deputy-leader" title="recently became the deputy leader of the UK Independence Party"&gt;recently became the deputy leader of the UK Independence Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpErEVB9gcc" title="accused Strong"&gt;accused Strong&lt;/a&gt; during a US TV programme of being a central figure in a "collusion" between UN officials, business leaders and scientists to use climate change as a device to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong, a former oil and utilities industry executive who is currently a director of the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagoclimatex.com/" title="Chicago Climate Exchange"&gt;Chicago Climate Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, North America's only exchange trading credits for greenhouse gas emissions, rejected the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's true that I do get a modest fee from Chicago Climate Exchange, which I helped [to found], because I believe the cap-and-trade system, while not perfect, is one of the best ways to ensure that people have the incentive to reduce their emissions at the lowest cost," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a long way from suggesting that I could invent the climate change issue to make profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have business interests, but they are pretty modest and I believe that business has to contribute to the solutions. To do that, they have to be profitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong also rejected internet speculation by conspiracy theorists that he is a member of clandestine groups, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/charlie-skelton-bilderblog" title="Bilderberg Group"&gt;Bilderberg Group&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati" title="Illuminati"&gt;Illuminati&lt;/a&gt;. "I have got lots of connections, but they're not amongst them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the issue of whether humanity can tackle the environmental challenges he believes it now faces, Strong was downbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Analytically, I'm pessimistic," he said. "I believe the odds are against us for making the changes we need to make in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But, operationally, I'm optimistic because I believe that it is still possible. [It becomes] tougher the longer we delay it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why I'm trying all these things because I believe we should still be trying as long as it is still possible. My pessimism is based on whether I think we will actually make these changes …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The combination of population growth and the growth in consumption is a danger that we are not prepared for and something we will need global co-operation on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jun/23/maurice-strong-reacts-to-glenn-beck" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the full transcript of Leo Hickman's interview with Maurice Strong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change-scepticism"&gt;Climate change scepticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/global-climate-talks"&gt;Global climate talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/scienceofclimatechange"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/glenn-beck"&gt;Glenn Beck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/fox-news"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/leohickman"&gt;Leo Hickman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Fund for disabled people runs empty</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/23/disability-fund-has-no-money</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.4/61910?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Fund+to+help+disabled+people+runs+out+of+cash%3AArticle%3A1416760&amp;ch=Society&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Disability+%28Society%29%2CPublic+sector+cuts+%28Society%29%2CWelfare+%28Politics%29%2CSociety%2CPolitics%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Society+Weekly%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CSocial+Care+Society%2CHealth+Society&amp;c6=David+Brindle&amp;c7=10-Jun-23&amp;c8=1416760&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=Society&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FSociety%2FDisability" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Disability leaders shocked by announcement that the Independent Living Fund can consider no new applications this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A government fund that gives money to severely disabled people to buy care and support has closed to applications less than three months into the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Independent Living Fund (ILF), which helps more than 21,000 people, says it has run out of money for new grants for the rest of 2010-11. It is the first time the fund has had to close to applications since it was set up in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move has shocked disability leaders and raised fears for the future of the ILF, which is a quango employing 160 staff in Nottingham and using 90 self-employed regional assessors to verify use of payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Friend, chair of the disability charity Radar, said: "We are deeply concerned that the fund may go as part of the [government spending] cuts. It plays a vital part in ensuring that the most severely disabled people can live more independent lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about people being able to move out of the family home or away from residential care. It enables people to think about working. Without the fund, they couldn't do any of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ILF, which has a budget this year of £11.2m for Northern Ireland and £348m for the rest of the UK, makes payments averaging £316 a week. Its rules had already been tightened to restrict new applications to people aged 16-64 who were either self-employed or had a job for at least 16 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, applicants were required to be on higher-rate disability living allowance, hold savings of less than £23,000 and be receiving care and support worth at least a further £340 a week from their local authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of these restrictions, the fund has exhausted its resources for 2010-11. It will honour 600 new offers of support made since the start of April, but otherwise make no further awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Boyle, the ILF's chief executive, said: "Our first priority is the 21,000 disabled people we currently support to achieve high-quality, independent lives. Our trustees have acted quickly to protect this group and meet their responsibility to manage within budget."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund says its budget has not been cut, though the last three-year government spending review in 2007 put the ILF allocation for England, Scotland and Wales for this year at £356m – £8m more than it has in fact received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 93% of the budget goes to existing recipients. The average cost of their awards has risen from £296 a week in 2008, an increase of almost 7% in two years, in response to the growing cost of care packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyle said: "We are committed to continuing and developing the excellent service we deliver to our users, allowing them greater flexibility in how they choose to manage their funding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/disability"&gt;Disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-sector-cuts"&gt;Public sector cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidbrindle"&gt;David Brindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

According to reports in the Arab media, a fundraising party held by Sudanese immigrants and asylum seekers in Beirut in aid of a child with cancer, was raided by Lebanese security apparently on the hunt for illegal residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyewitnesses report that although most of those attending produced valid residency cards, this &lt;a href="http://www.sudantodayonline.com/news.php?action=show&amp;id=5502" title="Sudan Today Online (Arabic)"&gt;did not spare them&lt;/a&gt; from being handcuffed, beaten and racially abused. According to &lt;a href="http://www.sudantodayonline.com/news.php?action=show&amp;id=5502" title="Sudan Today Online (Arabic)"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.al-akhbar.com/ar/node/194300" title="Al-Akhbar (Arabic)"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; newspaper reports (in Arabic), the detainees were referred to as animals who "learned how to wear nice clothes" and "black pieces of coal", and lined up flat on their bellies. Some members of the police, seemingly ignorant of the fact that there are any Arabic-speaking black Arabs, asked some of the Sudanese how they spoke Arabic so fluently. The Sudanese responded that they were Arabs from Sudan. In disbelief, the officers thought that they were being mocked, and another round of beating started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lebanese authorities have launched an investigation, but deny that there was any racial motivation to the raid. On the skin-colour and race spectrum, Sudan is possibly the most African of the Arab League nations. Lebanon on the other hand, or at least the image the country portrays in the media, is fair and Occidental, both in culture and race (Lebanese applicants at my university regularly ticked the "Caucasian" box on application forms). This incident highlights the unspoken, unsettling chasm between the two nations in terms of popular perceptions of different races in the Arab world. While mistreatment of migrant workers attracts coverage, the subtleties of intra-Arab discrimination rarely do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lebanon is no stranger to such controversy. Following a &lt;a href="http://www.diretube.com/articles/read-flight-et409-exposes-lebanons-racist-underbelly-the-huffington-post_394.html" title="Diretube: Flight ET409 Exposes Lebanon's Racist Underbelly - The Huffington Post"&gt;plane crash&lt;/a&gt; in the country earlier this year, it was reported that "even though there were nine nationalities aboard the Boeing 737 jet, which burst into flames and crashed into the sea minutes after taking off in a violent thunderstorm on Monday morning, the Lebanese, naturally enough, only concerned themselves with one".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families of Ethiopian migrant workers were segregated into separate rooms and DNA testing and identification of dead bodies was prioritised for Lebanese citizens. Unfortunately, this, in addition to the well-publicised plight of foreign maids in the Lebanon and such insensitivity as manifested in the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/17/nubian-fury-haifa-wehbe" title="Guardian: Nubian fury at 'monkey' lyric of Arab pop star Haifa Wehbe"&gt;"Nubian monkey" affair&lt;/a&gt;, makes it hard to dismiss this episode as a one-off incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, in an unusual and unique phenomenon of Arab migration to Africa, the Lebanese remain the biggest non-African migrant minority in west Africa. This community goes back as far as the 19th century, spawning a racial sub-category of African-Lebanese mulattoes and amassing riches in Sierra Leone where it has dominated the diamond industry. In a typically colonialist fashion, this embracing of Africans does not seem to apply back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a public pan-Arab narrative to which all states adhere. Meetings of the Arab League are usually sessions elegising, praising and paying homage to the host country's leader and each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meme is that Arabs are all brothers in race, language, history, and anybody who dares suggests otherwise is a turncoat agitator in the pay of the west. Hence, both the Sudanese and Lebanese governments are doing their best to downplay the affair. The Lebanese ambassador in Khartoum even went so far as to praise being black by saying that "priests wear black as a sign of respect and that the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba" title="Wikipedia: Kaaba"&gt;Kaaba&lt;/a&gt; in Mecca is covered in black silk". As if the slurs were some sort of compliment. The Sudanese ambassador in Lebanon condemned a call to boycott Lebanese products as "sabotage". This is not surprising as Sudan itself does not have a glowing record of treating its non-Arab citizens particularly well. In addition, most Sudanese residents in Lebanon fled from such conditions in Sudan, which does not predispose the Sudanese diplomatic mission to a very sympathetic stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it is a region where few are innocent. Northern Sudan, which dominates the rest of the country politically and culturally, has since independence downplayed its African heritage and amplified its Arab and Muslim character, subscribing to the popular perception that Arabs are superior to Africans. Needless to say, according to statements on behalf of the Lebanese and Sudanese governments, this incident "will not affect the fraternal relations between the two nations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race"&gt;Race issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nesrinemalik"&gt;Nesrine Malik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Sons of Anarchy is cracking TV</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jun/22/sons-of-anarchy</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.4/98104?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Have+you+been+watching+*+Sons+of+Anarchy%3F%3AArticle%3A1416538&amp;ch=Television+%26amp%3B+radio&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Drama+%28TV+genre%29%2CUS+television+%28TV+and+radio%29%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CTelevision+and+radio+TV&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CTelevision+Media%2CTV&amp;c6=Phelim+O%27Neill&amp;c7=10-Jun-23&amp;c8=1416538&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Blogpost&amp;c11=Television+%26amp%3B+radio&amp;c13=&amp;c25=TV+and+radio+blog+%28television%29&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FTelevision+%26amp%3B+radio%2FDrama" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;The motorcycle gang show has a great cast and gripping plots. It really could be as good as The Sopranos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPOILER ALERT: Don't read this if you're still watching series one or intend to do so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a whole heap of &lt;a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/soa/" title="Sons Of Anarchy"&gt;Sons Of Anarchy&lt;/a&gt; on TV at the moment. &lt;a href="http://www.bravo.co.uk/shows/sons-of-anarchy/" title="Season two is on Bravo"&gt;Season two is on Bravo&lt;/a&gt; (Wednesdays, 10pm) but &lt;a href="http://www.five.tv/programmes/drama/sons-of-anarchy" title="season one is still running on Five USA"&gt;season one is still running on Five USA&lt;/a&gt; (Wednesdays, 11pm). I saw the first season on DVD. I'd not heard much about the show, but knew it was the story of a Californian outlaw gang, the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original Charter. The common description of it as "The Sopranos with motorbikes" was misleading and even made it sound a bit dumb – although the comparison is spot on in terms of quality, if not style and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was more the cast that got me interested: &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402271/" title="Charlie Hunnam"&gt;Charlie Hunnam&lt;/a&gt;, who plays club vice-president Jax, made a great impression as one to watch following his role as drama student Lloyd in Judd Apatow's excellent Undeclared. &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005408/" title="Katey Sagal"&gt;Katey Sagal&lt;/a&gt;, best known for her note-perfect comedy roles in Married...With Children and Futurama, is even better. It's no big shock that she's as good in straight dramatic roles; what is a surprise is how good she is as Jax's mother, Gemma, and how all her previous work vanishes from the mind when she's on screen. There's not a trace of Peggy Bundy or Leela. And then there's &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579/" title="Ron Perlman"&gt;Ron Perlman&lt;/a&gt;, who plays the club president and Jax's stepfather, Clay. How can you not love Ron Perlman? The day after popping in the first disc, I reached the episode 13 finale thoroughly impressed and a little the worse for wear after such a harrowing ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say season two hit the ground running is an understatement. Season one's climactic moves, where SAMCRO's hit on their gang member Opie, who'd been set up as a rat by wicked Agent Stahl, went tragically wrong – Opie's wife, Donna, was killed instead. The season ended with Jax learning the truth behind the hit, furthering his already massive disillusionment with the methods of the gang and questioning whether to tell his lifelong best friend Opie. That story alone would be enough meat to chew over in season two, but then well-organised white supremacists arrived, led by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0035060/" title="Adam Arkin"&gt;Adam Arkin&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="/" title="Henry Rollins"&gt;Henry Rollins&lt;/a&gt; playing his muscle. They're so evil they make SAMCRO seem saintly – almost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The season opener, Albification, rests comfortably in my mental top five list of standout TV episodes for 2010. Starting with a fractious peace among the bikers as they try to pin Donna's murder on the rival Mayan gang, it performed the kind of sucker-punch of an ending that this show excels at: Gemma had organised a party to get everyone to forget their squabbles. It looked like all the bad stuff that was going to happen in the episode had happened – and then Gemma was kidnapped and gang-raped by Rollins and his cronies. It was devastating TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I wasn't the only one expecting swift and brutal retribution to be meted out by SAMCRO but Gemma didn't tell Clay of her ordeal. So season two is all about the weight of secrets: both Donna's murder and Gemma's rape. It's about how secrets can inform almost every action, giving double or triple meaning to seemingly innocent lines of dialogue. It's also about how any secret has to be told, eventually, how they slip out and spread, eventually. Heady stuff. The two people Gemma had to tell were the best choices for dramatic purposes: Unser, the cop with terminal cancer, whose vantage point allows him to see the big picture of the clashing gangs, and Tara, Jax's girlfriend, mere moments after she'd had the "no more secrets" talk with her lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of this season as a bomb, primed in Albification, with a slow fuse that may burn through at any time leading to the finale. Throw in the IRA, porn producers, religion and the tension quickly becomes hard to bear and the show becomes impossible to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So have you been sticking with it? Are you enjoying the bumpy, obstacle-strewn ride the show is taking us on? Have you been wrong-footed by the amazing, unpredictable plotting? Have you been wowed by the depth of character – not just by the leads but supporting players such as suffering Opie, good cop Hale, less-good cop Unser and the rapidly strengthening Dr Tara? Or maybe you're just impressed by how constantly hungover and frazzled &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167649/" title="Kim Coates"&gt;Kim Coates&lt;/a&gt; looks as Tig?

      <title>Is Apple's iPhone polluting China?</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jun/23/iphone4-pollution-apple</link>

This is undoubtedly the most beautiful and sophisticated product I have created."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However in sharp contrast with this high-profile release, Apple has been silent about questions regarding their supply chain's heavy metal pollution. On April 16, 2010, 34 Chinese environmental organizations, including Friends of Nature, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, and Green Beagle, questioned heavy metal pollution in a letter sent to CEO Steve Jobs. 50 days have passed, and though the significant problems with the IT industry's violations of heavy metals standards have been reported through media, Apple has not given a word in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iPhone4 is sold in the US, Europe and elsewhere, but it was assembled in China. As the world's center for the processing of IT products, China's environment is paying the price. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and battery power production especially create heavy metal pollution and has particularly serious damage and consequences. To promote the development of a true shift to green business behavior, 34 environmental NGOs conducted research and found data on some heavily polluting suppliers to IT brands. Then they made communications on this issue with 29 IT brands including Apple. Now 50 days has passed and Apple, with all its high-profile environmental commitment, is one of the 8 companies who did not respond.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the conference, Mr. Jobs talked about the new features of the iPhone4 and its relatively low price, which has obviously become a competitive factor for this new phone. With its imagination and large sales, Apple has become the world's most valuable IT company. However people are starting to have doubts regarding Apple's silence on heavy metal pollution problems. Has Apple deliberately ignored its issues with environmental supply chain management in order to control costs and maintain price competitiveness? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course as consumers we want cheap and good products, however if these production processes are exceeding wastewater discharge standards and even causing heavy metal pollution, they will cause long lasting damage to the ecological environment and public health. Today, even though we enjoy "cheap" IT products, tomorrow our children will have to pay a thousand times the cost to clean rivers, lakes, soil, the ocean and even their own bodies of heavy metals. Therefore Apple and other IT companies will have to pay for the consequences, as British Petroleum is doing today.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If we do not agree on such a future, we can in a peaceful, rational and determined way express our expectations and demands to Apple and other companies to strengthen their control over heavy metal emissions. Apple Inc. has a responsibility to respond to our expectations, because they have always made a high-profile announcement of its green commitment. So when you purchase their products, you are also purchasing a commitment. Apple relies almost entirely on outsourcing, so if suppliers are left unchecked, and violate discharge rules and standards, the company also violates their commitment. Thus consumers have a right to request explanations to be made and corrective measures to be taken.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are already a number of successful cases of brand companies controlling suppliers' heavy metal pollution. One aspect is that China's environmental transparency has significantly improved. The pollution map database now contains over 60,000 corporate violation records from government sources. This allows brands to easily compare their list of suppliers with government issued non-compliant records. Currently GE, Nike, Wal-Mart, Esquel, Unilever, Mitsui Property and others have already started to use the database to track the performance of their suppliers in China. Through regular screening, more than one hundred companies with violation records have felt pressure over the past months and they have publicly disclosed their problems and corrective measures.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As noted above, currently Samsung, HP, Panasonic, Toshiba and other IT companies have made attempts to use public enforcement records for monitoring and managing their supply chain. But the lion's share of IT brands is still taking a wait-and-see attitude. Perhaps they are waiting for the final signal, that is, a clear-cut message from the consumers. For the ecological environment and public health, and to leave our children with safe and inhabitable land, please raise your voice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Ma Jun works at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/pollution"&gt;Pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/iphone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/waste"&gt;Waste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Port Elizabeth's townships</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jun/23/port-elizabeth-township-south-africa</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.4/5656?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+Cup+2010%3A+Port+Elizabeth%27s+townships+*+without+the+tour+bus%3AArticle%3A1416445&amp;ch=Travel&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Port+Elizabeth+%28Travel%29%2CSouth+Africa+%28Travel%29%2CCulture+%28Travel%29%2CTravel%2CWorld+Cup+2010+%28Football%29&amp;c5=Football+World+Cup%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CAfrica+Travel&amp;c6=Anna+Kessel&amp;c7=10-Jun-23&amp;c8=1416445&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Travel&amp;c13=World+Cup+2010+travel+guide&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FTravel%2FPort+Elizabeth" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Most eyes will be on Port Elizabeth's stadium today as England play, but Anna Kessel heads for the city's moving apartheid museum in the city's black township&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On visiting South Africa there is one piece of advice most people will give you: don't go to the townships. In a country where holidays are often tainted with paranoia and the constant question, "Is it safe?", it is easier to stick to the beach resorts and game parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, that means shutting yourself off from a large part of South Africa's "Ubuntu", or "humanity to others", as the Xhosa say. Ubuntu - the essence of being human - is one of the founding principles of the new South Africa. Hence the creation of organised township tours by bus, and sometimes on foot. But if the thought of "touring" a township sounds like poverty tourism, then what other options are there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the awkward and uncomfortable questions that have haunted my family holidays to South Africa over the years. Always there was a nagging thought in the back of our heads that "surely, there must be another way?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when my dad and I planned to visit &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/feb/27/world-cup-2010-travel-guide-port-elizabeth" title=""&gt;Port Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Cape – the seaside city where England will be playing their third World Cup game against Slovenia today – we thought long and hard about how best to incorporate a visit to a township. Without the tour bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad, who grew up in Port Elizabeth, had not been back in 16 years and, like most white South Africans, had limited experience of townships. His father ran a pharmacy in Korsten, a black area of the city, in which my dad passed much of his time as a boy. There, under the apartheid system, he witnessed the beginnings of the forced removals and creation of townships outside the city in the mid-1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad eventually emigrated in 1976, just as townships earned their reputation for violence and unrest, when riots and protest marches kicked into gear. Subsequent trips back to South Africa included only the briefest of visits to Port Elizabeth's Kwazakhele township, home to Evelyn and her family who cared for my grandfather; a family whose lives became closely intertwined with our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this visit though, we headed out unguided, our purpose to test if this is a place that tourists can visit independently. New Brighton seemed the obvious choice – it is the oldest township in the area, and bursting with history. It was the birthplace of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the armed wing of the ANC, home of leading political activists such as Govan Mbeki, and the backdrop for many of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athol_Fugard" title=""&gt;Athol Fugard&lt;/a&gt;'s plays about black South African life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly of all, New Brighton has created a world-class museum in the heart of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freewebs.com/redlocationmuseum/" title=""&gt;Red Location Museum&lt;/a&gt; is a very special piece of architecture that sits – without high walls, electric fences or armed response security guards – in one corner of New Brighton. The "red" refers to the red oxide painted on the corrugated iron shacks to protect them from rust, a recognisable feature of the area. Extraordinarily, Red Location has created an internationally renowned attraction without having separated itself off from the community it sits within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Township life went on uninterrupted as a woman carrying a sack of maize on her head took a shortcut across the forecourt of the museum, kids played on homemade go-carts, and a stray dog ran through the dust. The manifesto of the museum is to serve the local people as well as the tourists, acting as a powerful and living archive of the area's history. The project, which is part funded by Sweden's &lt;a href="http://www.varldskulturmuseet.se/smvk/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=126&amp;l=en_US" title=""&gt;Museum of World Culture&lt;/a&gt;, is currently building a library, marketplace and new housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the museum are 12 "memory boxes", or themed rooms. One is dedicated to the unsung heroes of apartheid, ordinary people's poignant stories of the part they played in the struggle. It is a sage reminder that it took millions of people to overcome apartheid, not just the tiny handful of figures that we recognise and celebrate. Now seemingly forgotten by the government, without compensation or recognition, these men and women struggle to reconcile their feelings of loyalty towards the ANC with having being let down by the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community heroes, such as Danny Jordaan South, Africa's World Cup chief executive, are prominently displayed in the entrance hall. Nelson Mandela's prison diaries are exhibited in a glass box. Along the back wall hangs a haunting photographic essay that details the story of the 1985 Langa massacre near Uitenhage, just outside PE. Audio snippets accompany the black and white photographs – a choir of women singing Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica – adopted as the ANC's anthem of liberation, and later the post-apartheid national anthem – along with the harrowing sound of a mother sobbing over her dead child. On another wall hangs a list of every South African who died in police detention during the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside, under a bright blue sky, we explored the surrounding area. The museum recommends several bars and eateries – Ekupholeni Leisure Centre (72 Ferguson Road, +27 78662 5628) on the main road is a newly renovated restaurant and B&amp;B with an enormous screen in the front yard on which to watch live football throughout the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner, Florence Singapi, is a visionary businesswoman who ran a catering stall during the 1970s at the nearby Wolfson rugby stadium, where the Black Springboks – segregated under apartheid – once played. She and her family have created what may be seen as a model of the future for township businesses – a very modern design with decking in the front yard and a polished steel bar inside. An "international" menu offers everything from South African &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/interactive/2009/dec/02/southafrica-worldcup2010-food" title=""&gt;bunny chow&lt;/a&gt; (curry served in a white bread loaf) to a full English breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florence's son, Xhanti, has travelled the world and speaks with passion on the subject of township tourism. "Post-1994, there's only been one face of South Africa that's been shown, and it's not the black townships," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were no-go areas, they were presented as rough insecure dangerous places. Which is not necessarily true. I was mugged in Rome, second day in a 30-day trip in Europe. Everything gone. But would I turn around and say Europe is not safe?" Xhanti believes that tourism is all about common sense. "If you confidently drive from A to B in the township, without stopping and attracting attention, you will leave here at midnight in one piece."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the road, at the roundabout, is the legendary Jeya Jazz bar (Sheya Kulati Circle, Corner Ferguson and Avenue A, +27 722 525 815, open 11am to midnight), run by husband and wife team Mawongo and Noxolo Jeya. Roger Federer's family have visited here, and Noxolo has just returned from a trip to Germany where the bar has picked up yet more international awards for enterprise. An atmospheric live music spot for South African jazz, Jeya's is football-themed and also serves food such as South African &lt;em&gt;braai&lt;/em&gt; (barbecue) although, as we found out, it is necessary to call and order meals in advance. Mawongo spoke proudly of the number of foreign tourists he caters for. "You can stay here until four in the morning!" he said, "we will make sure you get home safely. Sometimes we even ask the local police to see guests out of the township."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly ravenous, we wandered along the smaller lanes, lined with pastel coloured houses and picket fences, dodging puddles and stray dogs. A father and young daughter were selling fruit and vegetables. We bought bananas and pears and munched on them as my dad offered to take their photo. The father smiled proudly when he saw the digital image of his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dad took some final photographs of the surrounding streets – schoolchildren giggling on their way past – a woman called out to us in Xhosa. "Sisi (sister)!" she said, "be careful! The men sitting in that container are no good." We glanced back at the group she was talking about and suddenly felt edgy. It was broad daylight, but as Xhanti might say, we were making ourselves too conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a moment we were unnerved. But then we remembered the people we have met here – Xhanti, Florence, Mawongo and Noxolo – welcoming points of contact in a place where before there were only strangers. From an unknown township to a familiar and friendly place – for us New Brighton was a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We piled into the car and drove to Kwazakhele, just over the ridge, where Evelyn's daughters had prepared an evening meal for us. We told them about New Brighton. It is a place we will visit again - without tour guides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• The Red Location Museum is on the corner of Olof Palme and Singaphi Streets; +27 4140 88400; open Mon-Fri 9am-4pm, Sat 9am-3pm, closed Sun.
