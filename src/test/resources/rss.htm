      <title>Osborne and Alexander try to quash UK-Scotland currency union suggestion</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/29/osborne-alexander-quash-currency-union-with-scotland</link>
      <description>Chancellor and deputy respond to minister's claim that UK would have to form currency union to ensure economic stability&lt;p&gt;George Osborne and Danny Alexander have tried to quash any suggestion that the UK would agree to form a currency union with an independent Scotland after a minister privately conceded that one would have to be formed to ensure financial and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor and his Liberal Democrat deputy issued a joint statement to say that a currency union would fail because it would not be in the interests of an independent Scotland or the remainder of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Manchester United v Aston Villa  live!</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premier League updates from the match at Old Trafford&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/29/manchester-united-david-moyes-out-banner-aston-villa"&gt;United fans boo 'Moyes Out' fly-by protest banner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/mar/29/premier-league-saturday-matches-pictures-gallery"&gt;The best images from Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/live"&gt;Follow the live scores from today's matches elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email &lt;a href="mailto:scott.murray@theguardian.com"&gt;scott.murray@theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:36:22.435Z"&gt;2.36pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;90 min +2: &lt;/b&gt;So that's two 4-1 defeats in a row for Villa, though this is a slightly misleading scoreline. United deserve to win on balance, but then if Benteke had remembered to pack his shooting boots, we could be looking at something very different. That's football for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:35:07.909Z"&gt;2.35pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be three added minutes - and look what's happened in the first! Januzaj prods the ball past a despairing Delph down the left wing, and romps into space. He takes a touch and whips a mid-height ball towards the far post, where Hernandez sticks his boot up to guide home with force!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:32:58.323Z"&gt;2.32pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;90 min: &lt;/b&gt;Clark attempts to rake one home from the best part of 30 yards, but no no no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:32:16.042Z"&gt;2.32pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;88 min:&lt;/b&gt; Clark is rightly booked for a late trip on Fellaini, who should be commended for his hilariously brazen cheek in springing up to complain to the referee in the most animated terms, as though common-or-garden clumsy challenges are simply beyond the pale in his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:30:09.484Z"&gt;2.30pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;85 min: &lt;/b&gt;Tonev has been lively since coming on. He cuts in from the left and looks to curl one into the top right from the edge of the area. He really isn't far away at all. &amp;quot;Last week, Simon McMahon's daughter's birthday, this week, Millings,&amp;quot; notes Matt Dony. &amp;quot;It's all getting a bit CBeebies recently. Should we give them the bumps? Should we be making Mike the Knight themed cards?&amp;quot; I don't know what that is, but if you fancy making something with glitter and glue, feel free to send it in. I'll dig out the music from Vision On.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:26:57.583Z"&gt;2.26pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;83 min: &lt;/b&gt;United are more than happy to let the clock run down, something they're doing very professionally at the moment. A Villa goal in the next couple of minutes would give them pause, but the visitors aren't threatening right now. &amp;quot;Maybe the Glaziers can take a loan out against the club, the usual &amp;pound;1000 at 50,000% interest, and hire another plane for Tuesday,&amp;quot; suggests the tinder-dry David Flynn. Very droll, but for God's sake be careful, don't be giving those clowns any ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:24:16.653Z"&gt;2.24pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;80 min: &lt;/b&gt;Villa are imposing themselves on this match again, but United seem happy enough to sit back and let them enjoy possession in midfield, while shutting up shop nearer their own area. &amp;quot;Apotropaic (69 mins)?&amp;quot; splutters Simon McMahon. &amp;quot;I must admit I found myself a bit discombobulated when I read that. It would appear that Christopher Barnes is something of a bloviator.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:22:23.415Z"&gt;2.22pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;77 min:&lt;/b&gt; Benteke completes a hat-trick of misses, although this one was the hardest of all. Westwood, out on the left by the halfway line, rakes a spectacular diagonal ball into the area, where Benteke has run clear of the snoozing Buttner. Any connection sliding in and he's guiding that home from six yards, but his extended leg doesn't meet the dropping ball and the chance is gone. Strange as it may seem with United winning 3-1, had Benteke been on his game, Villa could be winning this match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:19:58.222Z"&gt;2.19pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;76 min:&lt;/b&gt; Tonev wins a corner down the left. Vidic batters the set piece out for a corner on the other side. Vidic clears that one, too. They're going to miss him, aren't they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:19:00.129Z"&gt;2.19pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;75 min:&lt;/b&gt; Rooney, with Bayern Munich surely in mind, is replaced by Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:18:34.144Z"&gt;2.18pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;74 min:&lt;/b&gt; This is pretty much all United at the moment, with the home side attacking regularly, and with purpose, down both flanks. Clark makes a couple of last-ditch clearing headers. Tonev looks to release some pressure with a romp upfield, but balloons a long-distance effort miles over the bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:15:39.160Z"&gt;2.15pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;71 min: &lt;/b&gt;Agbonlahor is replaced by Tonev. Play restarts, and the game is nearly over, Rooney dancing in from the left after gloriously bringing down a long hoof with one featherlight touch, and shooting hard and low from 12 yards. But his shot is blocked, and Villa still retain a little hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:12:59.970Z"&gt;2.12pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;69 min: &lt;/b&gt;An instant impact by Januzaj, who sashays past four half-arsed challenges down the left, glides inside, and attempts a low curler towards the bottom right. It's a highly decent effort, but one gathered with ease by Guzan. &amp;quot;Should United win, that banner could prove one of the most expensive apotropaic devices in history,&amp;quot; opines Christopher Barnes. &amp;quot;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;"&gt;Can the fans afford another one on Tuesday?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:11:28.769Z"&gt;2.11pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;68 min: &lt;/b&gt;Kagawa is replaced by Januzaj. Meanwhile Mac Millings, 67, has thought of a way to improve on the half-baked pun in the caption at the top of this report: &amp;quot;Replace Agbonlahor with Rehhagel, Johnston and two pictures of Phil, and you've Planes, Waynes and Otto Mo Neals. You're welcome.&amp;quot; Let's laugh along politely, folks, it is his birthday after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:10:40.075Z"&gt;2.10pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;66 min:&lt;/b&gt; Villa are enjoying the lion's share of possession. Weimann rips down the right and fires a low ball towards the near post. Benteke takes a touch and looks to round Vidic, who falls and takes the striker with him. Benteke claims a penalty - and you've certainly seen them given for that - but Villa don't even get the corner. Benteke was the only Villa player to seriously claim for that, which was strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:06:49.210Z"&gt;2.06pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;63 min: &lt;/b&gt;Bertrand is booked for replicating Buttner's earlier coming together with Albrighton, using Young as his personal prop in this performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:06:04.638Z"&gt;2.06pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;61 min: &lt;/b&gt;Fellaini plants an elbow across the bridge of Vlaar's nose. This wasn't as malicious as that nonsense with Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta on Tuesday night, but it was clumsy and worthy of a yellow. He really has to tidy himself up when making these aerial challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:04:14.373Z"&gt;2.04pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;59 min: &lt;/b&gt;Old Trafford responds to that goal in a high-volume fashion. Villa aren't of a mind to give this up yet, though. A sortie down the right comes to nothing, then Benteke battles for a long ball down the inside left, only to bundle out for a goal kick. This match would get interesting if Villa snatch a goal back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:01:29.023Z"&gt;2.01pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata, down the inside-right channel, strokes a diagonal ball towards the other flank, where Fellaini is breaking into the box. Vlaar is forced to hook out on the left. From the throw, Buttner heads down the inside-left channel towards Fellaini, again in the area. There's a mild kerfuffle, and then the ball breaks to Mata, who sweeps a low shot into the bottom left past the flat-footed Guzan. Villa should be level, and suddenly United have a two-goal cushion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:59:06.664Z"&gt;1.59pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;55 min: &lt;/b&gt;Weimann shaped to shoot, bombing down the inside right, only to connect face with turf instead of boot to ball. Fellaini was hovering behind him in a very suspicious fashion, but Villa don't get their free kick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:58:07.572Z"&gt;1.58pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;53 min:&lt;/b&gt; Villa are pressing United back, though. Paul Lambert will have pointed out to his team that they were certainly not second best in the first half, even if the scoreline suggested otherwise, and they've responded with confidence. Albrighton wins a little space down the right and whips a stunning cross onto the head of Benteke, six yards out. And the striker misses another golden chance! He slaps his header over the bar from close range. On the touchline, Lambert is down on his haunches, staring at the ground, thoughts flying through his head that would be best described as Glaswegian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:55:13.069Z"&gt;1.55pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 min: WHAT A MISS! &lt;/b&gt;Westwood, on the left-hand edge of the United box, chips a fantastic ball into the centre, splitting the home defence into a million pieces. Benteke, chesting down, is free, six yards from goal with only de Gea to beat. He swings his left peg at the ball - and takes a wild fresh-air swipe. Oh dear. He attempts to blast a second attempt goalwards, but Carrick is now in the environs, and hoicks out for a corner. From which nothing occurs. Villa should be level. That's an appalling miss from a highly talented player. They're always the worst, aren't they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:52:02.928Z"&gt;1.52pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;49 min: &lt;/b&gt;A lull already! Dear me. At least it gives us the chance to plug our &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/mar/29/premier-league-saturday-matches-pictures-gallery"&gt;gallery of pretty pictures from this here match&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:50:50.799Z"&gt;1.50pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;47 min: &lt;/b&gt;United on the front foot in the early exchanges, though not to any great effect, Young and Kagawa's move down the right petering out quietly enough. &amp;quot;It's my birthday, but I won't reveal how old I am,&amp;quot; chirps Mac Millings, 67. &amp;quot;And what better way to ring in another year spent among this embarrassment we call Humanity than by following the MBM while not watching the Big Match? Always the multitasker, I'm also taking care of my 2 year old, who spent the night puking on me and her mother. As if Mrs. Millings's indignity at sharing a bed with me wasn't enough. Moyes in, by the way - my opinion is as invalid as anyone else's.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:48:17.273Z"&gt;1.48pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And we're off again! &lt;/b&gt;Villa will wonder how they lost that half of football, having looked lively in attack down both flanks. The final ball was perhaps lacking: David de Gea didn't have a lot to do, other than pick the ball from his net after Westwood's free kick. It shouldn't take too much of a twist of the proverbial spanner to get things working for them, as Westwood, Albrighton, Agbonlahor and Benteke have all looked in the mood. United have made a change, though: Carrick has come on for Rafael, which should see Carrick taking Jones's position, and the centre back moving to right back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:34:47.368Z"&gt;1.34pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Half-time advertisement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:33:52.413Z"&gt;1.33pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata was in the process of 
 &lt;strike&gt;
  taking a fresh-air swipe 
 &lt;/strike&gt;
 &lt;strike&gt;
  at the ball
 &lt;/strike&gt; failing to execute a dragback when he was cleaned out by Bacuna, so he'll be quite happy with the way that panned out. And that's pretty much that for the opening 45. Fairly eventful, no? And that was just the action on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:32:31.558Z"&gt;1.32pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rooney nearly takes the net off the frame of the goal, his spot kick belted home at a fierce velocity, very much troubling the side netting on the right. Guzan went the right way, but had no chance: a better penalty you'll wait a while to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:30:43.216Z"&gt;1.30pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;44 min: PENALTY TO UNITED! &lt;/b&gt;Kagawa plays a diagonal ball into the area from the right. Mata, coming in from the other wing, is about to latch onto the ball and shoot from ten yards when Bacuna slides in from the right and upends him! It's as clear a penalty kick as you'll see, and probably should be a sending off as well. But it's only a yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:29:43.346Z"&gt;1.29pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;43 min: &lt;/b&gt;Westwood wins the ball in the centre circle with a crunching tackle on Kagawa. He sprays a long ball down the left channel for Benteke, who brushes Vidic out of the way but can't get a shot off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:27:19.281Z"&gt;1.27pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;41 min:&lt;/b&gt; Kagawa and Mata continue to combine well. They triangulate down the left, Kagawa eventually making it into the area. He's about to shoot when the impressive Clark, anticipating brilliantly, steps in to blooter clear. &amp;quot;When that plane flew past, did BT Sport show 23 pointless slow-motion replays of it in close up, as if to make a non-event seem dramatic?&amp;quot; wonders Stuart Goodacre. &amp;quot;They do for everything that happens on the pitch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:25:11.909Z"&gt;1.25pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;38 min: &lt;/b&gt;Villa ping the ball around awhile, and eventually Albrighton wins a corner off Vidic down the right. United don't deal with the set piece particularly well, the ball floating through the six-yard box near to Benteke's eyebrows and away to the left wing, where Fellaini allows Vlaar (!) to turn him this way and that. The resulting cross is half-cleared, allowing Delph the time to lift another ball into the box from the right. But this one's overcooked, and the danger is gone. United are impressive up front, but very uncertain at the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:22:20.584Z"&gt;1.22pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;35 min: &lt;/b&gt;A lull. Which allows us to furnish you with a bit of extra information regarding Old Trafford's response to this bloody plane (pictured below, looking much as expected) &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/29/manchester-united-david-moyes-out-banner-aston-villa"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:19:07.099Z"&gt;1.19pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;33 min: &lt;/b&gt;Mata floats a delightful looping pass down the inside-right channel. He's this close to finding Kagawa, rushing into the area. But Guzan reads the danger well, and is off his line in the sprightly fashion to claim the ball. Great play all round. Mata has been pretty stodgy since his arrival from Chelsea, but he's looking on his game today. As is Kagawa. United's forward play has been pretty impressive so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:16:51.788Z"&gt;1.16pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30 min:&lt;/b&gt; Albrighton, bombing down the inside right, is allowed to make his way across the face of the United box, then down the inside left to the byline, before chipping to the far post where Weimann can't retain possession. That was a magnificent dribble, though it should also be noted that the red carpet was rolled out: Fellaini's attempt to dispossess him was limp as you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:13:38.210Z"&gt;1.13pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;27 min: &lt;/b&gt;Kagawa is flipped into the air down the left. Free kick, ten yards from the byline. Rooney whips it into the Villa six-yard box, and Vidic is ready to slam a header home when Clark gets involved and guides it over the bar instead. Infuriatingly for United, they don't even get the corner, the referee deciding incorrectly that Vidic had got the last touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:11:45.485Z"&gt;1.11pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25 min: &lt;/b&gt;A really open feel to this game. Villa don't appear to have lost the faith after being pegged back, with Benteke, Agbonlahor and Westwood making nuisances of themselves up front, and Rooney, Kagawa and Mata seeing plenty of the ball down the other end. &amp;quot;A low for football?&amp;quot; begins Matt Dony in response to the entry on 2 mins. &amp;quot;Yes, certainly. A low for MBM entries, though? I'm not so sure. It's up against some strong competition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:09:04.023Z"&gt;1.09pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;22 min: &lt;/b&gt;Rooney looks to take a snapshot from the edge of the Villa box, but Clark gets in the way. Meanwhile, by all accounts, the much-rumoured second plane turned out to be trailing an advert for a certain bookmaking firm whose adverts over the past couple of years have ranged from the astonishingly unfunny to the tediously offensive. They're after some free publicity for their 6-1 offer on Alex Ferguson coming back. Suffice to say, if you want to place that bet, do it with Ladbrokes, Coral, Betfair, Bet365, SkyBet, Stan James, Betfred or Bwin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:07:01.890Z"&gt;1.07pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a response from United, who have flooded forward down both wings since going behind. Kagawa sashays in from the left, and on the left-hand corner of the area, floats a delightful cross onto the head of Rooney, in the middle, ten yards out. Rooney guides a deft header into the bottom right, and United are level! A previously very quiet and pensive Old Trafford explodes into life. The noise is such that you couldn't hear a jet engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:04:22.976Z"&gt;1.04pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18 min: &lt;/b&gt;And here's some real hurt on Villa, Rooney's knee banging into Guzan's noggin as the two contest a low cross from the right from Young. That was a decent move by United, and a completely accidental collision. Guzan looks like he'll be fine, and Rooney is sportingly apologetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:03:09.138Z"&gt;1.03pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16 min:&lt;/b&gt; Buttner is booked for a late lunge across Albrighton, who did well to avoid injury by hurdling over the clumsy challenge. Albrighton gets up and whips a free kick into the area, where Clark clanks a header over the bar from eight yards. A real chance to put some real hurt on United.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:01:55.146Z"&gt;1.01pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15 min:&lt;/b&gt; I'm probably being a wee bit unfair on both Westwood and De Gea, having seen that again. The keeper perhaps started out a step too far to his left, making it hard to get across, but the free kick was close enough to the left-hand post to be hellishly difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:59:41.898Z"&gt;12.59pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westwood takes a couple of calm steps, and whips a wonderful free kick over the wall and into the top left! It's a fine strike, though De Gea got a hand to it, and is of sufficient quality that he might be annoyed not to have done better. That wasn't tight in the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:58:12.843Z"&gt;12.58pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12 min: &lt;/b&gt;Rafael is an increasingly clumsy liability. He clatters into the back of Agbonlahor, who is making good down the inside-left channel. That's a free kick, just to the left of the D, in a very dangerous position. And a booking for the full back, who will be treading on eggshells for the best part of 80 minutes. And in serious danger of a red card if his recent display against Liverpool is anything to go by, which it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:56:31.038Z"&gt;12.56pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 min: &lt;/b&gt;A free kick for United down the right. It's whipped into the area, where Rooney is lurking near the right-hand post, but the striker can't get anything on the ball. This is a bit of a non-event so far, both in the air and on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:53:26.650Z"&gt;12.53pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8 min: &lt;/b&gt;Rafael clanks into Unidentified Villa Player down the left. Villa load the box and Westwood curls the free kick into the danger zone, but Vidic deals with easily enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:51:59.072Z"&gt;12.51pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6 min: &lt;/b&gt;Still no shape to this game. &amp;quot;I peered out of my bathroom window and could see the plane over Old Trafford,&amp;quot; reports Matthew Cobb. &amp;quot;But it's flying very high and the letters are very small. If you didn't know what it said, you wouldn't know. All seems a bit daft.&amp;quot; Aye. You can at least hear the plane, though. As it hovers above the ground, there's a constant drone of waaaaaah-waaaaaah-waaaaaaah, which is appropriate enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:49:53.494Z"&gt;12.49pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 min:&lt;/b&gt; Not much happening on the pitch, mind you. Villa have started brightly enough, Benteke trying to get something going down the left with a fancy backheel, but none of his team-mates anticipates the flick. United can't keep hold of the ball at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:48:31.695Z"&gt;12.48pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 min: &lt;/b&gt;The plane is over Old Trafford, and is met by a wall of boos. A new low for the MBM, this entry. And indeed for modern football. The state of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:46:36.309Z"&gt;12.46pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And we're off! &lt;/b&gt;Aston Villa set the ball rolling. They'll be kicking towards the Stretford End, in front of which they've won once in the last 31 years. Still, they'll be thinking if West Brom, Newcastle and Everton can cock a snook to the record books ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:45:24.738Z"&gt;12.45pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Moyes takes the stage, and receives a very warm reception from the folk inside Old Trafford. &lt;/b&gt;It may well be that the majority of the United support, whatever they think about the state of the team at the moment, have decided that there are limits, and enough is, accordingly, enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:38:35.204Z"&gt;12.38pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;I think these fans would have better spent their money by putting it into &lt;a href="http://www.unitedforcolitis.co.uk/"&gt;Darren Fletcher's charity&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; says David Moyes of the planned fly-by protest. &lt;/b&gt;He's more mildly amused than irritated, and is dealing with this whole business in a very dignified fashion. He's not the only one questioning how well these particular supporters have used their hard-earned cash. &amp;quot;I can't help but feel that for almost &amp;pound;1,000 the fans probably could have chipped in to get a considerably improved replacement for Fellaini,&amp;quot; suggests Owen Parsons, cracking wise because someone had to. The teams will be out soon - kick off hasn't been delayed - and Manchester United will be wearing their famous red and white ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:19:41.424Z"&gt;12.19pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relaxing pre-match spa treatment: &lt;/b&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, immerse yourselves in some calming jazz guitar, and let a few soothing vibraphone glissandos wash over you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T11:56:37.665Z"&gt;11.56am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manchester United welcome back Nemanja Vidic from suspension:&lt;/b&gt; De Gea, Da Silva, Jones, Vidic, Buttner, Fellaini, Fletcher, Kagawa, Mata, Young, Rooney.&lt;br /&gt;Subs: Giggs, Hernandez, Carrick, Nani, Welbeck, Amos, Januzaj.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aston Villa make two changes from the team that collapsed 4-1 at home to Stoke, with Ciaran Clark and Marc Albrighton replacing Nathan Baker and Karim El Ahmadi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Guzan, Bacuna, Vlaar, Clark, Bertrand, Albrighton, Westwood, Delph, Weimann, Benteke, Agbonlahor.&lt;br /&gt;Subs: Bennett, Steer, Sylla, Tonev, Holt, Lowton, Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T11:33:54.514Z"&gt;11.33am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Much as it'd be lovely to avoid the subject altogether, we'll have to deal with it I suppose. &lt;/b&gt;A collection of Manchester United fans, suffering like no others have suffered before, having not seen their team lift major silverware for ten months, have decided to rent a plane, ordering it to fly over Old Trafford before kick off today, trailing a banner emblazoned with the slogan WRONG ONE: MOYES OUT. A second plane is rumoured to have been chartered for similar sloganeering purposes. Not sure what that one will be saying, but there's a fair chance it will read STOP BUGGERING AROUND IN THAT PLANE, COME HOME THIS INSTANT YOUNG MAN AND CLEAN YOUR ROOM, THEN STRAIGHT TO BED WITHOUT TEA, MUM. That it's come to this at a grand old club.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>US president insists Russia must pull troops back from Ukraine border in discussion over Crimea crisis&lt;p&gt;Russian president Vladimir Putin called Barack Obama on Friday to discuss a US diplomatic proposal for Ukraine and the US president told Putin that Russia must pull back its troops and not move deeper into Ukraine, the White House said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was believed to have been the first direct conversation between Obama and Putin since the US and its European allies began imposing sanctions on Putin's inner circle and threatened to penalise key sectors of Russia's economy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It's hard to grasp,&amp;quot; said 66-year-old Bob Michajla, a volunteer who has been helping search part of the square-mile debris field. &amp;quot;These are all friends and neighbors and family. Everybody knows everybody in this valley.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Sir Michael Wilshaw to demand that early years providers prove they are preparing under-fives for academic rigours of school&lt;p&gt;Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of education, will this week warn childminders and nurseries that they will need to show more evidence to parents that they are preparing young children for the academic rigours of school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will insist that proof be provided to parents that progress is being made in key areas, and is also expected to usher in a new set of standards for providers of early years education. A source close to Ofsted said Wilshaw believed that there were &amp;quot;serious weaknesses in the information provided to parents, meaning it is difficult to hold providers of early education to account&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Edward Timpson says he misses children during week and believes fixed holiday dates for MPs would be beneficial&lt;p&gt;The children's minister, Edward Timpson, has said he misses his children during the week and that parliament should &amp;quot;go a lot further&amp;quot; to make its hours more family-friendly, primarily by setting fixed holiday dates so that MPs can guarantee to their children when they will be around the family home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MP for Crewe and Nantwich spends Fridays and weekends in his Cheshire constituency, living alone in London during the week. &amp;quot;I obviously don't see the children, which I wish was different,&amp;quot; he told the Guardian. &amp;quot;The fact is, children thrive on routine and stability and one thing that would make a massive difference is to have regular recess dates  so we can plan ahead in the knowledge that arrangements won't fall apart, causing huge disappointment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Augustus rules again as Rome acts to restore lost mausoleum</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/29/augustus-rome-lost-mausoleum</link>
      <description>On the 2,000th anniversary of the emperor's death work will finally start to reopen historic site to visitors&lt;p&gt;He was Rome's first emperor, the founder of a world-dominating imperial dynasty, and a builder of roads and stunning temples who brought peace to a far-flung empire; a man so powerful the Roman senate named a month after him. Now, on the 2,000th anniversary of the death of the emperor Augustus, the city of Rome is getting ready to honour its favourite son by saving his mausoleum from shocking neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in 28BC and as broad as a city block, the cylindrical mausoleum has seen better days after being sacked, bombed and built upon down the centuries. It was used as a bullfighting ring and a concert hall before it was finally abandoned, recently becoming a hangout for prostitutes and a handy toilet for tramps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Mercedes driver matches Jim Clark's British record of 33 poles&lt;br /&gt; Vettel second on grid, Rosberg third and Alonso fourth&lt;p&gt;Lewis Hamilton won pole position for Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix in a reprise of his success in Australia two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamilton, who was second in his first race at the Sepang International Circuit in 2007, produced a now familiar turnaround. His Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg had dominated for most of the weekend and won the third free practice session on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moyes blames 'ageing' squad for Man Utd woes</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/28/david-moyes-manchester-united-ageing-squad</link>
      <description>Moyes claims any manager would have struggled this year&lt;br /&gt; Chelsea manager JosÃ© Mourinho leaps to Moyes's defence&lt;p&gt;David Moyes has defended his disastrous first season in charge of Manchester United, claiming even Sir Alex Ferguson would have struggled had he still been the manager due to the &amp;quot;ageing&amp;quot; squad he inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferguson &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/08/alex-ferguson-retires-manchester-united" title=""&gt;retired in the summer&lt;/a&gt; having won 13 Premier League titles, two European Cups, five FA Cups and four League Cups. But he left with four of his first-choice team reaching veteran age. Nemanja Vidic, now 32, will leave for Internazionale in the summer, and Patrice Evra, 32, could also be on his way out. Robin van Persie, 30, and Michael Carrick, 32, are also in their fourth decade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>England v South Africa: World Twenty20: live!</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/29/england-v-south-africa-world-twenty20-live</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the action from England's group game in Chittagong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/28/england-world-20-game-south-africa"&gt;Vic Marks on England's must-win game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email &lt;a href="mailto:dan.lucas@theguardian.com"&gt;dan.lucas@theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or, if you like, tweet &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/DanLucas86"&gt;@DanLucas86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:35:01.591Z"&gt;2.35pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's Ravi Bopara, who is arguably England's most reliable player with both bat and ball in this format. He's unlucky here as Buttler allows one to clip the inside of his legs on its way through for four byes. It's not been the best night behind the stumps for Matt Prior's apparently-annointed successor. Bopara takes a surprisingly long time between balls for someone with such a short run up. There's a chance as Amla gets a leading edge here and it loops up past the bowler, but neither fielder charging in from the rope can get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First they said Hashim Amla wasn't a Test player. Then they said he wasn't an ODI player. This week, they said he wasn't a T20 player!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:29:25.106Z"&gt;2.29pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tredwell continues and de Kock really can't get hold of him, walking down the wicket and squirting the ball to wherever he can. Amla shows him how it's done with a wristy cover drive to go to his highest international T20 score, before a single from the final ball takes him to a maiden 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:26:32.609Z"&gt;2.26pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're getting back underway now. I've got dinner plans tonight: we've had 7.3 overs in 54 minutes. This must be incredibly difficult for the batsmen, having their momentum interrupted so frequently thanks to a venue that's clearly not fit for purpose. I dare say it'll be a while before Bangladesh gets to host another ICC event. The final ball of the over is met with a beauty of a wristy cut behind square on the off side &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt; for four. They need a sweeper out at backward point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:22:29.397Z"&gt;2.22pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is like hearing your grandmother talk about how great 'Gangnam Style' is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:19:42.924Z"&gt;2.19pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;strike&gt;
  Goes out
 &lt;/strike&gt; bloody stays on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:17:12.060Z"&gt;2.17pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hessian is being dragged over the outfield to mop up the dew, which is very much to the advantage of the fielding team. If the lights stay on through England's innings (whenever we get there), and South Africa have to bowl with an increasingly damp ball, then they will be justifiably unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:14:25.590Z"&gt;2.14pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanLucas86"&gt;@DanLucas86&lt;/a&gt; Floodlights coming back on one bulb at a time suggests ideas coming into Danny Morrison's mind. More interesting though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:14:05.726Z"&gt;2.14pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broad now. I was going to add in that last over that perhaps Tredwell and Bopara only offer the illusion of extra control as they don't bowl in the overs when the batsmen are inclined to attack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Kock is struggling to get Broad's short stuff away here, but we only get three balls in the over before the lights go out again! And the DJ cranks the music up louder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:11:25.735Z"&gt;2.11pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not publishing any lazy jokes about de Kock's name, &lt;i&gt;Gary Naylor and Simon McMahon&lt;/i&gt;, so the rest of you can all stop trying to think of them now too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Tredwell is on now. Is there a case for bowling him in the powerplay as Gary Naylor suggested? Or if not then Bopara? They seem to offer the most control of any of England's bowlers, although as soon as I say that de Kock cuts him effortlessly for four through backward point again. A bad misfield by Jade effffggggggnnnnnrrrr Dernbach, diving over the ball, then allows a couple more. Eight from the over but it should have been fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:07:20.555Z"&gt;2.07pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Jordan, arguably England's most exciting young fast bowler now that Steven Finn no longer exists, is on to have a bowl. After a single to de Kock Jordan bowls one back of a length and beats Amla all ends up, with the batsman looking to absolutely cream it behind point. He does cream the next one: having seen what one short ball looks like he whips the next one over mid-on for four. Jordan comes back well though with a good ball in the blockhole, but then sends one a long way down the leg side. There seemed to be a bit of movement off the seam though there for Jordan. A single dropped into the leg side brings up the 50 partnership, before a couple of runs off a full toss complete a good powerplay for South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T14:01:05.336Z"&gt;2.01pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Bresnan is on and begins with a short, wide one, which de Kock will be disappointed to have chopped into the ground. That was asking to be hit for four. Ooh there's a big shout here as Amla swivels and looks to hoik it over the keeper. He miscues it and it loops to the 'keeper, the bowler and fielders go up but Buttler isn't interested and Steve Davis says no. Ah it's come off his pad. Amla then lofts one straight back over the head of Bresnan for his fourth boundary, in addition to those two sixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:56:51.457Z"&gt;1.56pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dernbach also gets another over, which won't please Gary Naylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanLucas86"&gt;@DanLucas86&lt;/a&gt; There's plenty to have a pop at with Jade, but powerplay hard ball overs are really tough for seamers. Spinners should bowl them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:53:03.499Z"&gt;1.53pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanLucas86"&gt;@DanLucas86&lt;/a&gt; How do we get the message across that Jade Dernbach is not an international cricketer, can someone hire a plane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:52:38.982Z"&gt;1.52pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moeen Ali gets a second over, unlike Thursday night's game. De Kock takes a single into the offside to get off the mark before Amla cuts another four from a full-ish ball through backward point. Another lovely shot from Amla, who was struggling for form coming into this. He comes down the track looking to whip it to cover, misses and Buttler drops the ball, &lt;b&gt;missing the stumping&lt;/b&gt;! I reckon there might have been a nick there too. The next ball is, almost inevitably, lofted over mid-wicket for six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:48:53.859Z"&gt;1.48pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right the last two balls of the over coming up and England have stuck a man on the deep backward square leg boundary. Two dot balls and that's the second over finally done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:47:32.986Z"&gt;1.47pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hessian was dragged around the grass to remove the dew, which seems a little unfair as it's unlikely to happen ten overs into England's innings is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:46:21.502Z"&gt;1.46pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's on the bloody DJ's booth. Bon Jovi's 'It's My Life' and 'Gangnam Style'. It's a wonder the guy hasn't been strung up from the stadium rafters by this crowd for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:42:54.173Z"&gt;1.42pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second lighting tower is out now. This might take a wee bit longer to get going again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:42:06.874Z"&gt;1.42pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has happened before in this tournament, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any Sparky fancy a quick trip to Chittagong.same tower as last time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:40:11.959Z"&gt;1.40pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanLucas86"&gt;@DanLucas86&lt;/a&gt; and Dernbach brings Amla back in form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:39:10.945Z"&gt;1.39pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should be back soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:37:50.129Z"&gt;1.37pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England also have a slip in place for Amla facing Jade Dernbach. Make of that what you will. Amla does as he will to Dernbach's second ball, which is back of a length on leg stump and picked up beautifully for a Greenidge-esque six over square leg. You can't blame the tattooed one for that much; his line was poor but it was a wonderful shot. Jade doesn't learn though and a similar ball is flicked away uppishly through the same reason, over the fielder for four more. Dernbach is straying further and further towards the leg side, sending a wide down that side of the stumps, before the lights go out and the stadium is plunged into darkness...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:33:52.822Z"&gt;1.33pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has been the way in each of England's matches so far, Moeen Ali will open the bowling. There's a bit of turn and South Africa get off the mark with a wide, before Amla drives the first boundary of the day through cover. A single worked to mid-on and England have a slip in for de Kock with the ball set to turn away from the left hander. Just six from the over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hi Dan,&amp;quot; writes John Starbuck. &amp;quot;I too am feeling smug, having just ingested some home-made bread with mozzarella and two cheeses (Wensleydale and Double Gloucester) plus fresh figs and a bottle of Pecorino. Whether I shall feel the same after the match is altogether a different matter but, genuinely, you just can't call this one in advance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:27:06.958Z"&gt;1.27pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both nice and short, and thus over and done with quickly. Here come the openers De Kock and Amla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:20:01.756Z"&gt;1.20pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Antoinette Muller:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoked to see Parney play, but considering England's ineptitude against spin...

Unsurprisingly, he'll have a bowl first. Team news to follow shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T13:00:01.592Z"&gt;1.00pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England will be out if they lose today, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:56:18.031Z"&gt;12.56pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:51:01.956Z"&gt;12.51pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I barely recognised a tanned Nick Knight out in Chittagong. He looks like a slightly lost, bemused version of David Hasselhoff with that bouffant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:45:03.184Z"&gt;12.45pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's rather strange to see Ricky Ponting offering up the expert analysis, isn't it? I'm not for one second questioning his knowledge, what with his number of international runs exceeding mine by some 27,000+, but he was never really into T20 was he, and only bothered playing 48 matches overall in his entire career. Somehow I thought he'd be above all this strong/weak zones, colour-coded sixes and spurious stats nonsense the host broadcasters are sluicing through our screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:40:19.652Z"&gt;12.40pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed on this very same desk, those with a preference for Manchester United (ha!), Aston Villa, football or Scott Murray will be happy to know that he's on &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/29/manchester-united-aston-villa-live-mbm"&gt;MBM duty for United v Villa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:36:49.685Z"&gt;12.36pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brendon McCullum hit a quick half century in the chase because of course he did. By my (admittedly dodgy) maths, this means that England absolutely have to beat South Africa or they're relying on other results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-03-29T12:30:36.137Z"&gt;12.30pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Afternoon folks.&lt;/b&gt; Whisper it very, very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; quietly, but England have been, well, alright so far, haven't they? I mean the bowling and the fielding have been as poor as we've come to expect since the start of the (hopefully now passed) winter, and Ashley Giles' selection policy remains questionable, but with the bat they've done rather decently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stuart Broad's side began&lt;/b&gt; with a competitive total of 172-6 against the highly-rated New Zealanders and, although they may not have defended it with Brendon McCullum in the mood, they were a touch unlucky to lose it on Duckworth-Lewis and certainly little blame can be afforded the batsmen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Comments made to Guardian by goverment minister at heart of pro-union campaign will be major boost for Alex Salmond&lt;p&gt;A currency union will eventually be agreed between an independent Scotland and the remainder of the UK to ensure fiscal and economic stability on both sides of the border, according to a government minister at the heart of the pro-union campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The private admission comes amid increasing jitters at Westminster, after opinion polls showed an increase in support for independence despite the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats all arguing that Scotland could not keep the pound after a yes vote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Government is to lift cap on the amount of money councils can spend in discretionary housing payments for tenants&lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg signalled on Friday that the government is to lift the cap on the amount of money councils can spend in discretionary housing payments for tenants in difficulties due to the introduction of the bedroom tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement is not an injection of extra government funding, but will give councils greater flexibility to help tenants who say they cannot afford the extra cost, or have nowhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Head of major inquiry into Medomsley detention centre in County Durham shocked by scale of historical sexual abuse&lt;p&gt;Police investigating sexual abuse at a Durham detention centre say they believe they have uncovered an organised paedophile ring operating in the 1970s and 80s with more than 500 potential victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of a 70-strong major inquiry into historical abuse at the Medomsley detention centre, near Consett, told the Guardian the inquiry was triggered by mounting evidence about isolated individuals. However, they were now investigating a complex paedophile ring, with many more victims than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Artist Antony Micallef describes decision not to display his work Kill Your Idol on London tube station posters as censorship&lt;p&gt;The artwork shows a bound Jesus being judged by an X-Factor-style jury and for 40 days it will hang over worshippers in the church where Byron was christened. But while the Church of England has welcomed the image, it has led to an unholy row with Transport for London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TfL has taken exception to the piece by artist &lt;a href="http://www.antonymicallef.com/index2.html" title=""&gt;Antony Micallef&lt;/a&gt; that was scheduled to appear on tube platform posters during Lent, alongside other contemporary art interpretations of the passion of Christ that have been deemed acceptable by the transport authority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experience: I fell through a wood chipper</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/29/experience-i-went-through-woodchipper</link>
      <description>'One of the truck drivers who didn't know we were up there turned on the machine. I fell on top of it and it sucked me down'&lt;p&gt;I had seen the porcupine wood chipper shred some big logs in the 10 months I'd been working at Swanson Bark Wood Products in Longview, Washington. It's&amp;nbsp;a powerful machine, but I'd never really worried about an accident before. I like industrial work  doing something physical helps pass the time. Plus, I needed a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this part of the States it gets really cold in January, and this year was no different. I was working nights, so was wearing a couple of T-shirts, a sweatshirt, a hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, steel-capped boots, jeans and thermals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Amateur footage shows the moment Joanne Milne from Gateshead, who has been deaf since birth and is now 40 years old, hears for the first time. Joanne has a rare medical condition called Usher syndrome, and as a result also began to lose her vision in her 20s. She was fitted with cochlear implants at a hospital in Birmingham in February, and is visibly overcome with emotion when hearing a nurse read the days of the week</description>

      <title>The Edinburgh Comedy festival is dead  long live the Edinburgh fringe</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/29/edinburgh-comedy-festival-edinburgh-fringe</link>
      <description>The demise of this land grab-cum-marketing initiative shows how the fringe defies attempts to control and corporatise it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a rare thing these days to hear of corporate interests being thwarted, so let's enjoy it while we can. The so-called Edinburgh Comedy festival is no more. Not, I hasten to add, the Edinburgh festival fringe  the most glorious, un-curated, profuse, all-life-is-here arts beanfeast in the world  which is still going strong. No, the ECF was a land grab-cum-marketing initiative undertaken in 2008 by the supposed &amp;quot;big four&amp;quot; comedy venues on the fringe, whereby &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/mar/26/doesthefringeneedaseparat" title=""&gt;they launched their own festival-within-a-festival brand&lt;/a&gt;, released their own brochure  and relegated the hundreds of comic acts elsewhere on the fringe to second-class status, implying (even assuming anyone noticed them any more) that they weren't really in the &amp;quot;comedy festival&amp;quot; at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beauty: Mother's Day gifts</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/mar/29/beauty-mothers-day-gifts-sali-hughes</link>
      <description>'As a single mum, there's no one around to engineer the pantomime of your children giving a damn about Mother's Day. I feel this is ample justification for a spot of self-gifting'&lt;p&gt;The thing about being a&amp;nbsp;single mum is that when your children are little, there's no one around to engineer the pantomime of Mother's Day by buying a present or helping them make a card. I feel this is ample justification for a spot of self-gifting. I often choose hand cream, since most of the year is spent grabbing some generic supermarket moisturiser that lives next to the J-cloths and Fairy Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jointly sharing the top of this year's list are &lt;a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/hand-and-nail-cream-30ml/p/p22300503" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roger &amp;amp; Gallet Bois D'Orange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;pound;6), for my handbag, and &lt;a href="http://www.feelunique.com/p/Aromatherapy-Associates-Renewing-Rose-Hand-Cream-75ml?utm_source=GoogleBaseUK&amp;amp;utm_medium=gen&amp;amp;option=48661&amp;amp;catargetid=1665049966&amp;amp;aff=mrn&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term={keyword}&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Product+Listing+Ads+NEW&amp;amp;mkwid=BCXiC9nu_d{device}&amp;amp;pcrid=28149025749" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aromatherapy Associates Renewing Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;pound;23), for next to my bed. Both smell delicious, cosset dry skin and even out ruddiness. Also containing rose are &lt;a href="http://www.esteelauder.co.uk/AerinBeauty/products/mpp/index.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT12586" title=""&gt;Aerin's easy-peasy, good-on-every-woman &lt;strong&gt;Rose Balm Lipsticks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;pound;25). Somewhere between balm and classic lipstick, they're rich in moisture, subtle in colour and the packaging is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mummy's boy: Yotam Ottolenghi's recipes for Mother's Day</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/28/mothers-day-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi</link>
      <description>You'd be hard pressed to find any dish that isn't suitable for Mother's Day, but it would be churlish not to make a bit of an effort&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been a bit frenzied to say the least. My&amp;nbsp;next book, &lt;a href="http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/plenty-more/9780091957155" title=""&gt;Plenty More&lt;/a&gt;, which is due out in September, has very much passed its deadline, and all the extra writing and photoshoots, on top of my ordinary routine, mean I've turned into a bit of a middle-aged male stereotype: I'm forever forgetting this, dropping that and generally neglecting to keep tabs on&amp;nbsp;my responsibilities. So when my editor at the Guardian nudged me last week to say my next column was more than reasonably late, I had to delve into the recipe file kept for just such emergencies and came up with today's three dishes that are only loosely related, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not usually one to panic, I began to fret about how I could thread them together without anyone noticing the obvious flaw. Then I&amp;nbsp;remembered what tomorrow&amp;nbsp;is (see what I mean about forgetting?): Mother's Day to the rescue! After all, you'd be hard pressed to find any dish that isn't suitable for Mother's Day. (Stuffed tripe, maybe, or veg in aspic, but I'm not sure even those two could be completely ruled out.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Homes and gardens spring special: salad days</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/28/how-to-grow-own-salad-alys-fowler</link>
      <description>It takes just five packets of seed to grow a season's worth of&amp;nbsp;greens. Alys Fowler launches our summer salad challenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2014/mar/28/summer-of-salads-in-pictures"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In pictures - how to sow salad seeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am quietly confident that everyone can grow great salads. There's a risk your radishes may go woody; the lettuce could taste bitter or, worse, a slug may dine first; but if you fail at pea shoots and rocket, I suggest someone takes your pulse. With a bit of space in pots or beds, and a few packets of seed  lettuce, radish, rocket and peas, say  for the&amp;nbsp;price of a couple of bagged supermarket salads, you have seeds enough for the whole season. So ditch the bag of slime in the bottom of the fridge and try a summer of home-grown salads instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a window can grow pea shoots. If you can lay claim to some outside space, you can make a&amp;nbsp;success of rocket, too (if it bolts, don't worry: the flowers taste lovely). Once you have mastered these two, the world is your salad bowl, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Darren Aronofsky has created an epic and stylish adaptation of the biblical flood story, but doesn't quite overcome the traditional difficulties of the genre&lt;p&gt;Darren Aronofsky, director of Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream, has here created a sombre, powerful biblical epic, shot through with a certain beserk grandeur and gloomy portentousness. Its desire to do justice to the spirit, if not the letter, of the scriptural source should not be doubted; Aronofsky, who co-wrote the script, has given us a grimy, roughened Noah story  one spattered with the blood of sacrificial victims, coated with snot and tears, and mostly lit by smoky torch flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fleshing out, and embroidering, on the biblical narrative, Aronofsky and his co-writer Ari Handel have conceived of their Noah as an doughty warrior with a husbandman's conscience  early on, he tells his son off for picking one of the sparse flowers growing out of the rocky soil, saying: &amp;quot;We take only what we need, only what we can use.&amp;quot; His boatbuilding mission is constructed as an implacable desire to ensure the earth  or &amp;quot;creation&amp;quot; as it is tenderly rendered  is eradicated of all humankind, including himself and his family: another scene has him cheerfully informing his young children in which order they'll bury each other, and which one will die alone. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which phones do world leaders use?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/28/which-phones-world-leaders-use</link>
      <description>Apple and Samsung are hoping for some powerful customers as BlackBerry goes into decline. Could even Obama switch?&lt;p&gt;For years, the well-connected world leader would use nothing but a BlackBerry to get their email on the move  and it is still Barack Obama's phone of choice. He uses a model specially enhanced by the US National Security Agency. But the news earlier this month that the White House Communications Agency is testing other phones, including models by Samsung and LG, sent shivers through fans of the struggling Canadian smartphone company, which has &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/28/blackberry-revenues-below-1bn-dollars" title=""&gt;just announced an annual loss of $5.8bn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a world leader, security is much more than just having a passcode on your phone; it also means protecting it against attempted incursions from all the amateur and professional hackers, and more importantly spy agencies, who want to know to whom, when, what and where you have been speaking and reading. For a country's leader to have their phone eavesdropped is the ultimate failure of their national spy agency, and a huge loss of face. With enhancements, BlackBerry has been the spy agencies' phone of choice to guard against that so far. Now, though, Apple and Samsung  the two largest makers of smartphones  are starting to knock on the security services' doors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Joanna Trollope: 'I'm amazed my archives have raised any interest'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/mar/28/joanna-trollope-amazed-archives-have-raised-interest</link>
      <description>Teased for her 'Aga sagas', Joanna Trollope thought no one would want her papers but Oxford snapped them up. She is thrilled  as well as hopping mad about this week's announcement of a ban on posting books to prisoners&lt;p&gt;I haven't heard anyone abbreviate &amp;quot;pious&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;pi&amp;quot; since my great aunt died  and she was born in the first world war. Joanna Trollope was born during the second world war, making her only just a generation younger, close enough to share a fondness for Enid Blytonesque slang  but that is where the similarities end. The novelist has the figure of a 14-year-old, the presence of a Hollywood star, and so much feminist fury about tabloid misogyny that whenever she sees women reading the Daily Mail on the tube, &amp;quot;I want to whip it out of girls' hands and just say: 'Please read something proper!'&amp;quot; She is without question the most contemporary 70-year-old I have ever met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's only afterwards that I realise she didn't mention her age once. The whole subject of ageing never even came up  which is odd, given what we talked about. It emerged this week that Trollope has donated her entire archive of manuscripts and notes to the &lt;a href="http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley" title=""&gt;Bodleian library in Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, so a&amp;nbsp;preoccupation with mortality and posterity would have been perfectly natural. But Trollope seems to be too distracted by her own astonishment to have even thought about it. &amp;quot;Do you know,&amp;quot; she marvels in her famous cut-glass vowels, &amp;quot;I'm just absolutely amazed that the donation's aroused any interest at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Super Puma helicopter crash: survivors on Britain's toughest commute</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/29/super-puma-helicopter-crash-survivors-britains-toughest-commute</link>
      <description>In August 2013, a helicopter crashed in the&amp;nbsp;North Sea killing four oil rig workers. It was the fifth serious incident involving Super Pumas in as many years. Survivors talk about what happened&lt;p&gt;One day last August, Paul Sharp woke in his room on the &lt;a href="http://www.dolphindrilling.no/index.php/fleet/borgsten" title=""&gt;Borgsten Dolphin oil rig&lt;/a&gt;. He had been on the night shift, then slept for five or six hours, so it was getting on for midday. He showered, dressed, then, after lunch in the canteen, packed his bags and took them up to heli admin to be weighed. Sharp has been a scaffolder on the rigs for nearly 23 years, working two-week blocks of 12-hour shifts, often in brutal weather: horizontal snow, screaming wind, icicles as tall as&amp;nbsp;a room and waves that lapped at 75ft-high platforms. He commutes from East&amp;nbsp;Hull, where he was born and now lives with his wife and daughter in a neat, low house facing a church and a main road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight was running late, so Sharp went back downstairs to watch TV. When the call finally came, he returned to heli admin, a small room for a large and diverse bunch: the crew, plus 18 passengers, 17 men and one woman, working as safety officers, electricians, caterers, welders; old hands like Sharp, and those for whom the whole thing was still new, such as James Nugent, who had also just come off a night shift and was on only his second trip offshore. Nugent is a&amp;nbsp;tall, well-built South African, weathered and emotionally open. After a&amp;nbsp;career in the film industry and running a B&amp;amp;B, he&amp;nbsp;became a rope access instructor, specialising in work at heights or in confined spaces. We talk in a&amp;nbsp;restaurant perched on a point of land just outside Newquay in Cornwall, where he lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to bake with spices</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/29/bake-with-savoury-spices-recipe-ruby-tandoh</link>
      <description>Shake up your bakes by introducing flavourings normally used in savoury dishes  shunning the cinnamon can make for an invigoratingly radical take on classic biscuits and cakes&lt;p&gt;Some spices are at the heart of baking: cinnamon can transform the fortunes of even the saddest apple pie, while nutmeg turns plain custard into gold. Cloves are the taste of Christmas. My favourite is just a couple of cardamom pods, split and ground, to brighten banana bread. It's easy to slip into a spice rut with such a delicious basic repertoire, but we miss out when we steadfastly stick to just these spices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we rigidly categorise &amp;quot;sweet&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;savoury&amp;quot; spices, our baking suffers. Black pepper, coriander, chilli, caraway, celery seed, and even mustard or juniper berries  all typically accessories to savoury dishes  can be used in sweet baking with exciting results. It's tempting to play to the autumnal notes of a carrot cake with a predictable spoonful of cinnamon, but why not ring the changes with a dose of caraway seeds instead? Likewise, the heat of a ginger biscuit can be bolstered by a good grinding of pepper. Carefully balanced, these spices will give a familiar cake, bun or biscuit a new lease of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dave Eggers: what's so funny about peace, love and Starship?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/28/dave-eggers-starship-mohegan-sun-casino-connecticut</link>
      <description>Dave Eggers always prided himself on his musical taste  and wouldn't have minded being called a snob. So what happened when he found himself watching a 70s revival band in a casino shaped like a wolf's den in the Connecticut woods?&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this&amp;nbsp;trip could be summed up neatly: I was driving from&amp;nbsp;New York City&amp;nbsp;to central Connecticut, to&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;casino called Mohegan Sun, owned by and greatly enriching the descendants of a&amp;nbsp;subjugated Native American tribe, to&amp;nbsp;see a&amp;nbsp;friend of mine sing for a rock'n'roll band called Starship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should back up. Starship is a band that emerged from another band, Jefferson Starship, which itself emerged from a previous band, known as Jefferson Airplane. The latter was an iconic band of the 1960s: they played Woodstock, Altamont, Monterey, and were central to San Francisco's Summer of Love. Jefferson Starship was&amp;nbsp;the 70s incarnation of the band, after various original members of the band had departed. Starship was yet one more version, prominent in the 1980s and featuring singers Grace Slick and Mickey Thomas. They scored a colossal hit with the song &amp;quot;We Built This City,&amp;quot; and soon after, Slick left the band, and they stopped recording. But periodically after that, Thomas would tour under the Starship name, playing smaller venues and casinos like the one&amp;nbsp;at Mohegan Sun, in the middle of one of the oldest states in the Union.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hemlines and hirsuteness on the rise but Don Draper sticks to the Brylcreem for the final season of TV show&lt;p&gt;Mad Men has entered the 1970s; you can tell by Peggy Olsen's hemlines. A mid-thigh skirt, considered transgressive in the 60s, is now acceptable office attire in the final season of the TV show which premieres in the UK on 16 April.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fringe circus: the art of hair-hanging</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/29/fringe-circus-hair-hanging-capilotractees-circusfest-roundhouse</link>
      <description>The quirky show CapilotractÃ©es at the Roundhouse's CircusFest brings back an old hair-raising artform  with playful and sometimes painful results&lt;p&gt;On the scale of physical pain, there are certain things that inflict a disproportionate ouch: paper cuts, a prang to the funny bone, hair pulling. But if a tug on tangled tresses is bad enough, now imagine what it would feel like to suspend your whole bodyweight from your ponytail. That's not a torture technique, that's entertainment. The hair hang is an old circus act, currently being revived by two Finnish artists, Sanja Kosonen and Elice Abonce Muhonen, in their show &lt;a href="http://www.cryingoutloud.org/project/capilotractees-hair-hang-by-sanja-kosonen-elice-abonce-muhonen/" title=""&gt;Capilotract&amp;eacute;es&lt;/a&gt;, coming to London as part of the Roundhouse's CircusFest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosonen and Muhonen are part of a wave of contemporary circus artists reviving old circus tricks with knowing modernity (another Finnish act, &lt;a href="http://agitcirk.com/" title=""&gt;Agit-Cirk&lt;/a&gt;, do their own take on the cannonball-to-the-stomach strongman routine). The hair hang is thought to have originated in China and involves tying up the hair with a metal ring and then dangling from it, preferably performing a few other feats  juggling, acrobatics, whatever you've got in your armoury  while you're up there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 10 chateau hotels in France</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/28/top-10-chateau-hotels-in-france</link>
      <description>From the Loire to the Alps, Alastair Sawday picks 10 gorgeous chateaux to stay in across France, where the characterful rooms are as impressive as the food, wine and garden views&lt;p&gt;Deep in the Loire countryside, this 18th-century chateau has been in the same family for six generations and is now run by the relaxed Fran&amp;ccedil;ois de Valbray, his wife (an excellent cook) and their children. They are rightfully proud of their splendid home, with its handsome interiors decorated in traditional style. The drawing room is a symphony of red velvet, and a marble staircase sweeps up to 10 opulent bedrooms. A local sparkling Cr&amp;eacute;mant de Loire is the perfect ap&amp;eacute;ritif before a candlelit three-course meal prepared by your hosts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; Doubles from 110 room only, +33&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;41 42 00 02, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.briottieres.com/uk/index.php" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;briottieres.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why are pub landlords in low spirits?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/28/why-are-pub-landlords-in-low-spirits</link>
      <description>Many of us imagine that running a pub could be a great job, but a recent survey found it to be one of the most miserable jobs in the country, with long hours and relentless pressure. Pete Brown gave it a go behind the bar&lt;p&gt;'Can you go round and check there's no dead bodies in the toilets, Pete?&amp;quot; asks Will, who has been showing me the ropes. &amp;quot;Flush anything nasty away and then lock them with the bolts at the top.&amp;quot; As&amp;nbsp;Petra, another member of&amp;nbsp;the team, finishes mopping the floors,&amp;nbsp;and Andrew, the shift manager, cashes up the tills in the office downstairs, I slump on to a bar stool, knackered. It's 12.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not that my first shift behind a bar for over 20 years has been physically arduous. It's just that I'd forgotten what it was like to be alert and on duty at a&amp;nbsp;time when I'm normally nursing a pint on the other side of the bar or thinking about going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Fatal Attraction just can't be sexed up for the stage</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/28/fatal-attraction-sexed-up-stage</link>
      <description>Trevor Nunn's production with Natascha McElhone and Mark Bazeley shows that cinema is better than theatre when it comes to sex, voiceovers and structure&lt;p&gt;With more than half of current West End productions having originated as films  a stage version of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/26/fatal-attraction-theatre-review" title=""&gt;Fatal Attraction&lt;/a&gt; arrived last week, with &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/dec/07/let-the-right-one-in-review-royal-court-london" title=""&gt;Let the Right One In&lt;/a&gt; due to follow soon  producers clearly assume that movie scripts and stage plays are interchangeable forms. However, the staging of Fatal Attraction makes specifically clear why they are not. Sir Trevor Nunn's production fails because of three things that cinema does better than theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The FA is a decent, well-intentioned punchbag of a body. Give it a break</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/28/football-association-sport-england-amateur-footballers</link>
      <description>Sport England has docked the FA Â£1.6m a year because of the reduction of amateur footballers which seems a little unfair on an organisation that has no real control over the issue&lt;p&gt;The news this week that Sport England has cut its funding to the Football Association was greeted with a more nuanced reaction than might have been expected. Generally these things only tend to go one way with the FA, which has always existed as a kind of punchbag-body, a repository for free-floating rage and anxiety just waiting to be scooped up and marched around in a headlock, the straw shaken out of its trouser legs like a decorously mouldering scarecrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this occasion my first thought was this must be a long overdue sanction for the appalling cheap-suit corporate match-day experience of Wembley stadium, with its cretinously intrusive PA announcer who sounds at all times as though he's just been hit on the head with a rock and it's the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Have Wu-Tang Clan produced the weirdest 'album' yet?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/mar/28/have-wu-tang-clan-produced-the-weirdest-album-yet</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wu-Tang Clans next album is to be presented in a museum, not sold on iTunes. From Becks sheet music to the Flaming Lips chocolate skull, here are five other unusual albums&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/wu-tang-clan-one-copy-new-album-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin"&gt;Wu-Tang Clan are to release their new album in a one-ofa-kind, hand-carved nickel-silver box&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently sitting in a Moroccan vault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The songs will never be sold on iTunes or streamed on Spotify: if you want to hear Once Upon a Time in Shaolin youll have to head to one of the galleries, museums or festivals it will be taken to, pay for admission and listen on closely monitored headphones. The group later hope to sell the album for millions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Work begins on the world's first 3D-printed house</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/mar/28/work-begins-on-the-worlds-first-3d-printed-house</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zero waste, lower transport costs and recyclable materials  is 3D-printing the future of housebuilding? Dutch architects are putting the process to the test for the first time in Amsterdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treacle-black plastic oozes from a nozzle at the bottom of a small tower in Amsterdam, depositing layer upon layer of glistening black worms in an orderly grid. With a knot of pipes and wires rising up to a big hopper, it looks like a high-tech liquorice production line. But this could be the future of house-building, if &lt;a href="http://www.dusarchitects.com/"&gt;Dus Architects&lt;/a&gt; have their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this small canal-side plot in the north of the city, dotted with twisting plastic columns and strange zig-zag building blocks, the architects have begun making what they say will be the world's first 3D-printed house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Google naps: mapping the world's best places to sleep</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/28/google-naps-maps-sleep</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A parody site set up by Dutch developers uses Google's map data to share tips on where to catch forty winks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've all done it. Last night was just a bit too good and your head is sinking ever closer to your desk  you need a nap, but wheres the nearest bed, bench or comfy patch of grass?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter&lt;a href="http://www.googlenaps.info/"&gt; Google Naps&lt;/a&gt;, a parody of the venerable Google Maps, that lets users share the best places in towns and cities around the globe to grab a quick bit of shuteye. Think of it as Foursquare for beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sergey &amp;amp; Larry (and other Googlers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, please don't be mad this is just a joke, a parody. We don't mean to damage your brand or anything, we just want to bring a smile on the faces of Google fans. So please don't take this to court, we only have a few hundred Euros in the bank. And we also don't want to go to jail because we're too busy with other things at the moment. But whenever you are in the Netherlands you can have a nap on our couch if you want, just email us. We can also make coffee and bake eggs if you like that (for a small price).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lucy Mangan: After bingogate, we've all got the Tories' number</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/29/bingo-poster-shapps-lucy-mangan</link>
      <description>Kudos to Grant Shapps and co for managing to reveal so much about what they really think in so few words&lt;p&gt;I'm torn about the whole &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/20/budget-beer-bingo-row-westminsters-social-media-battleground" title=""&gt;bingo poster thing&lt;/a&gt;. On the one hand, who can help but rejoice in the gifting unto a nation of such a deliciously succinct and effective piece of anti-propaganda from, by and about the government? &amp;quot;Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty,&amp;quot; their post-budget poster proudly proclaimed. &amp;quot;To help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy.&amp;quot; Praise be to the Treasury department who, it is claimed, designed it, to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne" title=""&gt;the Gidiot&lt;/a&gt; who apparently signed off on it and to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/grant-shapps" title=""&gt;the Conservative party chairman&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/grant-shapps-bingo-and-beer-joke-causes-twitter-storm" title=""&gt;tweeted it&lt;/a&gt;. The latter's propensity for involvement in this kind of joyfully unmitigated balls-up (remember him justifying &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/bedroom-tax" title=""&gt;the bedroom tax&lt;/a&gt; on the grounds that two of his three children share a&amp;nbsp;room?) must surely make the coining of a new verb  &amp;quot;to Shapp things up&amp;quot;  imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the poster and its&amp;nbsp;11-word encapsulation of the Conservative mind was first revealed to the world,&amp;nbsp;I've been lingering over it,&amp;nbsp;tracing&amp;nbsp;its elegant contours and marvelling at how they manage to do so much with&amp;nbsp;so little. First,&amp;nbsp;to spin&amp;nbsp;with such abandon a&amp;nbsp;penny off a&amp;nbsp;pint and a&amp;nbsp;cut in bingo industry tax&amp;nbsp;rates that will do nothing to increase prize&amp;nbsp;money or&amp;nbsp;reduce entrance fees. And then&amp;nbsp;to cleave the world&amp;nbsp;neatly into Us and&amp;nbsp;Them, and to position your party so&amp;nbsp;clearly as&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;Us so uniformly, impenetrably overprivileged that all sense, all empathy, all imagination (and any other property that goes to make up an ability to&amp;nbsp;conceive of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;world in which those outside your charmed circle are&amp;nbsp;not puppets but people) has&amp;nbsp;withered and died.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beware the surveillance reform Trojan horse: what's not in the new NSA laws?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/29/surveillance-reform-whats-not-in-new-nsa-laws</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here's what the privacy geeks are worried about after a whirlwind week  that the spies might get more out of these bills than Snowden or the people he tried to protect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week was undoubtedly a turning point in the NSA debate. Edward Snowden &lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/edward-snowden-nsa-reforms-mark-a-turning-point-20140325"&gt;said it himself&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, as some of the NSA's most ardent defenders, including the House Intelligence Committee and the White House, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2014/mar/27/nsa-bulk-data-reform-bills-compared"&gt;suddenly released similar proposals&lt;/a&gt; endorsing the end of the NSA's bulk collection of phone records as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping the government from holding onto of all Americans' phone metadata would undoubtedly be a good thing for American privacy, but if you read between the legislative lines, the government might not be curtailing mass surveillance so much as permanently entrenching it in American law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Arab renaissance is a centenary we must honour in 2014</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/29/arab-renaissance-centenary-2014</link>
      <description>The Arab world should again embrace the principles behind this great intellectual awakening and its dream of a borderless nation&lt;p&gt;In the first months of 2014, in the midst of a crisis in Ukraine that recalls all but moribund European rivalries, much has rightfully been made of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the European civil war that would come to be known as the first world war. But, while the great war understandably looms large in western memory, it features prominently in the cultural memory of the west Asianorth Africa region too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we continue to live with the consequences of &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/middle_east_01.shtml" title=""&gt;foreign intervention in the wake of the great war&lt;/a&gt;, of new borders drawn that failed to recognise the economic, social and environmental interdependence of the Arab lands in the Levant. The current polemics between the west and Russia  while Ukrainians and Syrians fight, suffer and die  are darkly reminiscent of the colonial mindset of a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why do we pay more council tax than oligarchs in Knightsbridge palaces?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/29/why-do-we-pay-more-council-tax-than-knightsbridge-oligarchs</link>
      <description>The unwillingness to charge appropriate amounts of council tax on the properties of the super-wealthy is inexplicable. Some London boroughs could multiply their top rate by more than 100&lt;p&gt;An upbeat letter arrived recently from my local council, which is the London borough of Islington. Despite cuts in central government funding that mean the council has had to find &amp;pound;122m savings between 2011 to 2015, the letter was pleased to say that the council tax would be frozen for the fifth year running, thereby saving the average payer &amp;pound;375 to date. As I'm in band G, the second-highest, the tax due during the next year will again be &amp;pound;2,101.45 to be divided between Islington and the Greater London Authority, minus a discount of &amp;pound;100 given to &amp;quot;older persons&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To hand over &amp;pound;167 a month in exchange for schools, libraries, social services, road mending, street cleaning, refuse collection etc looks a tremendous bargain, though, of course, the expense of these things is mainly met from the business rate and general taxation via central government grants, which have also subsidised the freeze. The controlling instinct of Westminster never lets local government get above itself. And property ownership, being the a sacred fact and leading aspiration of British life, mustn't have too noticeable a cost other than interest on the money borrowed to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>24-hour childcare and the working parents conundrum</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/29/24-hour-childcare-working-parents-brent-council</link>
      <description>Brent council's new initiative is a worthy attempt to help parents forced into unsocial working hours, but is symptomatic of our inability to value family over economic activity&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;Brent council is set to offer 24-hour childcare places.&amp;quot; That sentence has all the makings of a Twitterstorm. You can imagine it causing controversy in an era before Twitter; that tinderbox crackle where, before you even know what you think, you know you're about to get into a really big fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On closer inspection, 24-hour childcare isn't the baby factory it sounds like; these are not nursery places, strip-lit municipal halls full of travel cots, where you drop off your bug-eyed, exhausted young at 3am so you can pull a cleaning shift that starts at 5am. &lt;a href="http://www.brent.gov.uk/services-for-residents/family-and-schools/nurseries-and-childcare/flexible-child-care/" title=""&gt;These are childminder places&lt;/a&gt;, inexpensive (&amp;pound;5.33 an hour) and in a&amp;nbsp;home environment. The idea&amp;nbsp;didn't start in a thinktank full of 28-year-olds telling each other through glass partitions that Alzheimer's can be really&amp;nbsp;easy to manage, so long as the carers have a group texting app. It started with Muhammed Butt, the Labour leader of Brent council. &amp;quot;My wife&amp;nbsp;has been a&amp;nbsp;childminder since before I was a&amp;nbsp;councillor. People come to her and tell her what they need. She's&amp;nbsp;been feeding that back. Parents are now working two or three part-time jobs, not full-time jobs. And a lot of these jobs are in anti-social hours. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/28/hands-up-who-would-work-if-they-had-access-to-cheaper-childcare" title=""&gt;Where do they leave their children?&lt;/a&gt; They need somewhere safe and reliable. Mondays to Fridays, 8 until 6, that's what they'll get from a&amp;nbsp;nursery,&amp;nbsp;and it isn't enough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Workers are treated with contempt. This should be Labour's focus</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/29/workers-treated-with-contempt-labour-miliband-deborah-orr</link>
      <description>Ed Miliband's 'cost-of-living crisis' is just a symptom of a&amp;nbsp;market system not delivering the prosperity its&amp;nbsp;proponents promise. We need mutual respect between bosses and workers&lt;p&gt;Poor Ed Miliband. He is neither the problem nor the solution. Instead, he's the inevitable product of a&amp;nbsp;Labour party that doesn't know what it is&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;what it wants. That's the problem. The Labour party doesn't know what it's for any more, and it has ended up with a leader who doesn't know, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a socialist party any longer. It is not dedicated, as it once was, to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2004/sep/16/clausefourmar" title=""&gt;achieving workers' ownership of the means of production&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the reinvention Blair provided, in 1997, has been rejected, by voters and members. Miliband doesn't have an alternative, and when he stood as party leader, he didn't offer one. What is the Labour party now dedicated to, or what should it be dedicated to? Such a question tends to elicit responses such as &amp;quot;social justice&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;equality of opportunity&amp;quot;. These may be pleasing concepts. But they are goals, rather than definitions. For me, it's quite simple. The Labour party can reinvent socialism pretty easily. It should stand for the idea  the&amp;nbsp;fact  that workers &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the means of production, and should therefore be&amp;nbsp;treated with respect. That's true to the party's traditions, and also happens to strike at the heart of many of this country's difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A no vote in Scotland will be no endorsement of Britain</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/scottish-independence</link>
      <description>The campaign against independence has been so relentlessly negative it risks depriving the UK of a moral mandate&lt;p&gt;What works best, a negative message or a positive one? What is it that truly motivates voters, their hopes or their fears?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions are currently the subject of a grand experiment. The&amp;nbsp;subjects are the people of Scotland, with the experiment due to come to a head on 18 September. That's when they will deliver their verdict on Scottish independence, thereby passing judgment on the campaign to halt it  a&amp;nbsp;campaign that has, even its defenders admit, been relentlessly negative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Vladimir Putin became evil</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/why-putin-crimea-strategy-west-villain</link>
      <description>The US and UK condemn him for Crimea but supported him over the war in Chechnya. Why? Because now he refuses to play ball&lt;p&gt;Once again, it seems that&amp;nbsp;Russia and the United States are finding it difficult to agree on how to deal with their respective ambitions. This clash of interests is highlighted by the Ukrainian crisis. The provocation in this particular instance, as the leaked recording of a US diplomat, Victoria Nuland, saying &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/feb/07/eu-us-diplomat-victoria-nuland-phonecall-leaked-video" title=""&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck the EU&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; suggests, came from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several decades ago, at the height of the cold war, George Kennan, a leading American foreign policy strategist invited to give the Reith Lectures, informed his audience: &amp;quot;There is, let me assure you, nothing in nature more egocentric than embattled democracy. It soon becomes the victim of its own propaganda. It then tends to attach to its own cause an absolute value which distorts its own vision  Its enemy becomes the embodiment of all evil. Its own side is the centre of all virtue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>As they say at Manchester United: football ownership  bloody hell</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/manchester-united-takeover-class-92-qatar-beckham</link>
      <description>Manchester United's class of '92 are bringing the John Lewis model of ownership to the game  except for the Qatari bit&lt;p&gt;Our history isn't yours to buy, fumes one of the fan banners at Manchester United  except, of course, when it is. But is now such a time? It's never quite clear, in this surreal age when a football club can be bought with a loan for which it is itself the collateral. But reports that &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2590691/Manchester-Unite-deny-rumours-David-Beckham-Qatari-royal-family-set-buy-Glazer-family.html" title=""&gt;United are the target of a Qatari bid&lt;/a&gt; fronted by the club's so-called &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/class-of-1992-salford-city-deal-agreed" title=""&gt;Class of '92&lt;/a&gt; are too phantasmagorically intriguing to ignore  not least for the club's share price, which perked up rationally at the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday it was confirmed that Ryan Giggs, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul&amp;nbsp;Scholes and Nicky Butt had bought&amp;nbsp;non-league Salford City, subject&amp;nbsp;to FA approval. At the same time&amp;nbsp;reports suggested that the latter quintet, plus David Beckham, are also the frontmen for a bid to relieve the Glazer family of Manchester United. Now, if that sequence of acquisition feels a bit like someone exchanging on a studio flat above a bookies one day, only to put in a bid for Versailles the next, then you are strongly urged to just&amp;nbsp;adjust your mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>So much for the so-called people's police, if they treat protesters like this</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/public-order-force-peoples-police-stephen-lawrence-taser</link>
      <description>From Stephen Lawrence to today's Taser revelations, Britain's forces of law and order have defiled the idea of the public sphere&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The police are the public and the public are the police,&amp;quot; said the &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CEMQFjAC&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.impsec.org%2F~jhardin%2Fgunstuff%2Fwritings%2FPeels_Principles_Of_Law_Enforcement.pdf&amp;amp;ei=R3M1U_7sJKHQ7AbtrYHoCw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHE6E40zYs3x7R_sS1UrhkSm2LUwg&amp;amp;sig2=ZA4laAEn6TO-0aJyVqwKFw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.63808443,d.ZGU" title=""&gt;force's modern founder, Robert Peel,&lt;/a&gt; in the early 19th century. Never has a fundamental principle come to sound so hollow. Everything from the treatment of domestic violence victims and the appalling treatment of the Lawrence family to the Hillsborough campaign smears, undercover spying on protestersand today's &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/27/police-use-tasers-rises-sharply" title=""&gt;revelations about Taser use&lt;/a&gt;  even the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/26/police-sacked-plebgate-andrew-mitchell" title=""&gt;stitch-up of a high-level government minister&lt;/a&gt;  reveals quite the opposite: that the police regard the public as a dangerous, entirely separate thing, to be surveilled, imprisoned and physically restrained wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police force manifestly does not understand itself to be part of this &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; public, but rather a separate agent dealing with an always potentially dangerous mob, some of whom can be pre-emptively singled out on the basis of poverty, ethnicity or opposition to state policy (or a combination of these) and reminded of their place: big brother is watching you, and if you catch him in the act he'll harass, smear and stomp on you until you get back in line. The police are the public, we could say, but not the public of the people, where the term originates, but the public of &amp;quot;public order&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Good mothers don't overload kids with adult baggage  they let them be kids</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/mar/28/good-enough-mothers-not-overload-children</link>
      <description>Mothers can get it wrong in two ways: they are either too emotionally absent or too emotionally present&lt;p&gt;Philip Larkin may have found the words: &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178055" title=""&gt;&amp;quot;They fuck you up, your mum and dad.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; But his nearish contemporary &lt;a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html" title=""&gt;John Bowlby&lt;/a&gt; explained how and why. So what better subject than Bowlby for Mother's Day weekend? Mothers  or significant carers  can get it wrong in at least two very different ways: they can either be too emotionally absent or too emotionally present. Those mothers who give the impression of not caring or who deprive their children of love and affection tend to create children who grow up into clingy, emotionally needy adults. In contrast, those who emotionally over-rely upon their child, wanting the child to be the adult to their own messy and complex needs, or those who create an overly intense home environment, can create children who grow up into emotionally avoidant adults. This is how problems with &lt;a href="http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/attachment.htm" title=""&gt;what Bowlby called &amp;quot;attachment&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; come to be transmitted down the generations; how, in Larkin's narrowly gendered words, &amp;quot;Man hands on misery to man&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments in the 1970s, Bowlby's collaborator, Mary Ainsworth, sought to quantify the proportions of those who have problems with attachment. She created an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH1m_ZMO7GU" title=""&gt;environment called the &amp;quot;strange situation&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, where a child is abandoned by his or her mother for various periods. Of those children who took part, 60%  those whose parenting was generally secure  were distressed for a while, but soon comforted. Some 20% of children were extremely distressed, not easily soothed and often exhibited conflicted reactions to the parent's return, like wanting to hug them and punish them at the same time. And 20% weren't much bothered by the separation and continued playing with their toys when the parent returned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We can't ban pornography  but we do need to stop children accessing it</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/dont-ban-pornography-just-protect-children</link>
      <description>However inconvenient it may be for adults, we need to protect children from hurtful representations of sex and sexuality&lt;p&gt;Today the &lt;a href="http://www.atvod.co.uk/news-consultations/news-consultationsnews/Atvod-publishes-research-showing-scale-of-underage-access-to-adult-websites" title="Atvod website"&gt;Authority for Television on Demand&lt;/a&gt; (Atvod) published research telling us &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/28/primary-school-children-porn-websites" title="Guardian: Three in a hundred primary school children visited porn sites during study"&gt;children as young as six are accessing hardcore pornography&lt;/a&gt;. If we were to apply their study of 45,000 households nationally, that is 44,000 primary school children and 200,000 under-16s accessing adult sexual material; 112,000 boys aged 12-17 had visited one site alone, Pornhub. These figures aren't even a realistic assessment as mobiles and tablets do not feature in the research. We should be shocked by the scale of the problem before us and galvanised into action. This is not about banning pornography, but protecting children from harmful and often degrading representations of sex and desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atvod suggest forcing porn sites to complete age checks  failure to do so would result in an inability to process payments from UK consumers. So critical is the situation before us that Atvod has stressed the urgency of enacting legislation &amp;quot;during this parliament&amp;quot;. A spokeperson for the company said: &amp;quot;The material that appears on the free services is placed there by the paid services to attract customers to sign up to subscriptions. As long as the paid service placed content on a free service without age verification it would be in breach of its licensing conditions and so would not be able to access funds from the UK.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why are Britain's universities still failing black and Asian students?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/britains-universities-still-failing-black-asian-students</link>
      <description>NUS data shows ethnic minority students continue to face academic, social, and financial barriers  along with overt racism&lt;p&gt;New figures show that white university students &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/mar/28/white-students-better-degrees-minorities-same-grades-universities" title=""&gt;receive significantly higher degree grades than those from minority ethnic backgrounds&lt;/a&gt; with the same A-level qualifications. This suggests that higher education institutions are somehow failing black students, which should be a national embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago the National Union of Students (NUS) conducted a study on the experiences of black students. The findings showed that they face a range of barriers in all levels of education, which affect satisfaction and attainment. The figures made for uncomfortable reading. It emerged that one in six black students had experienced racism in their institution, a third felt their educational environment left them unable to bring their minority perspective to lectures and tutorials, and 7% openly labelled their learning environment as &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>So cats are giving us TB? It must be time to fight back</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/cats-tb-fight-back</link>
      <description>Let's stop pussy-footing around and get rid of these monsters before they've had their wicked way with us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what we have long suspected has finally come true; cats are trying to kill humans. Those furry evil geniuses who have been plotting from the comfort of your very own lap have revealed themselves &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/27/first-documented-cat-human-tb-infection" title=""&gt;as carriers of tuberculosis trying their best to infect their owners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years we've been wondering why they've been staring at us like that, why they are so withholding with their affection, why white cats only ever sit on your black clothes. It is all becoming terrifyingly clear now. First, they came for the sparrows and I said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Labour is part of the problem, not the solution</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/27/ken-loach-labour-failed-left-new-party</link>
      <description>Its rhetoric may be softer than the Tories', but the party still puts profit before people. Left Unity offers a new voice&lt;p&gt;Every day the Guardian publishes accounts of desperate poverty and attacks on welfare provision. We know of the food banks, the plight of disabled people and the housing crisis that affects so many. We know of the propaganda to make the poorest people scapegoats for economic failure. We recognise the hypocrisy of &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10647538/Cutting-benefits-part-of-a-moral-mission-Cameron-tells-new-Cardinal.html" title=""&gt;Cameron's &amp;quot;moral mission&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that housing support goes to rich landlords, that benefits for the working poor subsidise employers who pay poverty wages. We read that benefit fraud is a tiny fraction of the overall welfare budget, far less than unclaimed benefits, and is nothing compared to the amount lost through tax dodging. But as we rail against the injustice and hypocrisy, we fail to ask one big question. Where is our political fightback? It should be led by the Labour party but therein lies the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mental health stigma: where's my cheesecake?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/mar/28/mental-health-stigma-wheres-my-cheesecake</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt; There's a one in eight chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer in the average woman's lifetime. There's a one in 10 chance of developing depression. Yet we're far more likely to openly talk about one than the other. In a guest post, &lt;b&gt;Tania Browne&lt;/b&gt; complains bitterly about her lack of complimentary baked goods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once had a friend who was almost suffocated by cheesecake. She was a nice woman  let's call her Penny. I met her in a hospital, as you do. Penny was undergoing treatment for &lt;a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/breast-cancer/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and let's just say she was a little bit pissed off with it. Not the breast cancer, but the way she had become &amp;quot;Poor Penny with Breast Cancer How Tragic She's Only 38, You Know&amp;quot;. Penny felt that everything interesting about her had been stolen. She was no longer a clever woman who knew a lot about how &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant"&gt;ants form orderly societies&lt;/a&gt; by leaving chemical trails for each other, or how to get the best deal on a new washing machine. Cancer became a definition of who Penny was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had become quite literally the first thing people would ask her about. Not her opinion of &lt;a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/desperate-housewives"&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href="http://www.thebutterflysite.com/life-cycle.shtml"&gt;life cycle of caterpillars&lt;/a&gt; or any number of other interesting things she knew about. Just cancer. How her treatment was going, whether she looked &amp;quot;well on it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;not so great&amp;quot;  and because they could offer her nothing else constructive, they gave her food to show they cared. It started with a few casseroles for the slow cooker when she had chemo days, and escalated to cheesecakes and homemade choux pastry at an alarming rate. Weight loss was never an issue for Penny through her &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Chemotherapy/Pages/Definition.aspx"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;  she had raspberry pavlova to raise her spirits. I bet she still has cheesecake in her freezer from that time. And not just that, people she barely knew suddenly laid claim to her. A bloke with halitosis she got off with at the office Christmas party in 2004 ran a marathon with her face on his T-shirt.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I had reason to remember Penny and her profiterole problem over Christmas, when I myself was ill. At the beginning of December I went to my GP, he agreed with me that something was horribly wrong and I was prescribed both chemical and non-chemical treatments. I was honest, I told friends and family that I was battling against something nasty. I confess that I was partly hoping for a shower of cake, but unlike Penny's friends mine aren't terribly good cooks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But there was something else, too. Although aware of it, very few people asked me how my treatment was going. Even fewer told me if I looked better, or still much like I was auditioning for a new version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worzel_Gummidge_(TV_series)"&gt;Worzel Gummidge&lt;/a&gt;. People went quiet, distant. They left me alone even when I opined about how isolated I felt. I had very few people I could talk to about my condition, and only fellow sufferers seemed to care. Why?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I didn't have breast cancer. I was &lt;a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/depression/#.UzFKr_l_v74"&gt;depressed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There's no easy way to slide depression into a conversation. When people ask after you when you bump into them in the supermarket, it's OK to say you have a nasty cold or some irritating health issue (especially if they've caught you in the &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Haemorrhoids/Pages/What-happens-page.aspx"&gt;haemorrhoid cream&lt;/a&gt; aisle), but not OK to mention that it's the first time you've left the house since December and you're feeling pretty pleased with yourself for venturing out to buy toilet paper. Depression is invisible. You can't see it (though you might be able to smell it: at my worst I would go without showers for days at a time), it has no obvious physical symptoms, and people &lt;a href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-a-z/S/stigma-discrimination/"&gt;don't like to talk about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Why not? Let's examine this in more detail. If you ask about my depression, am I likely to:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; a) Shout &amp;quot;You know? At last, I'm free!!&amp;quot; And run around ripping my clothes off in the detergent section of Morrisons.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; b) Corner you with a monologue about how my therapist made me realise  remember that goth boy who looked a bit like &lt;a href="http://www.nickcave.com/"&gt;Nick Cave&lt;/a&gt; who dumped me when I was 15?  chances are we wouldn't still be together if dyeing my hair black had changed his mind, after all.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; c) Scream &amp;quot;YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME!!&amp;quot; And make a break for the nearest slammable door, bedroom or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Yes, people are often scared they'll say the wrong thing and show their ignorance of depression. Even though it's an issue for many, most of us know very little about it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The thaw of the US-Russian &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; that led to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start) in 2010 has passed and the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2014/mar/23/world-leaders-nuclear-security-russian-ukraine-crisis" title=""&gt;disarmament process is largely frozen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Piers Morgan fires parting shot at the NRA in final CNN show</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/29/piers-morgan-gun-control-cnn-final-episode</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attributing poor ratings to a feud with gun rights advocates, the host said a muted goodbye to the struggling news network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no big celebration for Piers Morgan, no cake delivered to his desk on-air, no interviews with his favorite guests, no serenade from Bette Midler. On the last episode of CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, the former British tabloid editor exited mostly quietly, after three years of ho-hum interviews and poor ratings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 58 of his 60 minutes, Morgan, a dutiful CNN-er until the end, talked exclusively about The Plane. Or, as CNN chyrons have branded the subject for what seem like hundreds or thousands of consecutive hours: &amp;quot;THE MYSTERY OF FLIGHT 370&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>'I wouldn't be children's minister if my parents hadn't fostered'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/29/edward-timpson-childrens-minister-parents-fostered</link>
      <description>Children's minister Edward Timpson was mocked as an out-of-touch toff when he became an MP. But his parents fostered nearly 90 children when he was growing up  ideal training for his current role, he says&lt;p&gt;One night in the&amp;nbsp;House of Commons, trying to stay awake for a&amp;nbsp;vote, Edward Timpson picked up Harold Macmillan's diaries in the library. &amp;quot;He was complaining about what an imposition it was to have to go back to his constituency once a month, and harking back to the halcyon days when it was an annual visit. You turned up on the train and there was a brass band on the platform and you waved out of&amp;nbsp;the window, made a speech and disappeared back to London.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics in 2014 could not be more different. Timpson, like most MPs, lives in his constituency, Crewe and&amp;nbsp;Nantwich. The 40-year-old Conservative children's minister is a&amp;nbsp;weekend dad, staying in London during the week, and doesn't like it. &amp;quot;I miss those impromptu, intimate moments that just being together brings. I&amp;nbsp;voted for more family-friendly hours and I think we could go a lot further.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How 'not married' is becoming the new normal</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/not-married-new-normal-relationships</link>
      <description>ONS figures suggest a rise in the number of 'singletons', but isn't it more a sign that marriage is now a frivolity more than a necessity?&lt;p&gt;Continuing its admirable tradition of providing the most &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/31/stats-nation-office-national-statistics" title=""&gt;vital and up-to-date numbers representing life in Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/mar/27/singles-england-wales-older-majority" title=""&gt;provided a map of all the single people in England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Ranging from coupled-up white to the deepest purple of failed relationships, the map pinpoints where all of those single-person households are hiding themselves  often among innocent suburban families who might have no idea that their streets are being marred by crazed cat-loving harpies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is safe, it turns out: purple patches turn up from Sunderland to Blackpool, Hull to Nottingham, Stoke-on-Trent to Plymouth. Most of all, our fair capital city has fallen victim to a deluge of people who couldn't even stick with a perfectly nice girlfriend, even if she did have a couple of anger issues and was distantly related. &amp;quot;The number of singletons has risen by 3 million in a decade&amp;quot;, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2590764/All-single-ladies-men-live-Islington-according-new-map-reveals-East-Dorset-hardest-place-partner.html?ITO=1490&amp;amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;amp;ns_campaign=1490" title="Daily Mail: How many single people live in your area?"&gt;crows the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out that Islington tops the tables with 57% of women and three in four male residents in the borough proclaiming themselves single.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deaf woman's emotional reaction to hearing sound reinforces the triumph of cochlear implants</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Footage of Joanne Milne is a powerful reminder of the life-changing nature of technology, writes Nicola Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment when 40-year old Joanne Milne, who has been deaf since birth, first hears sound is heart-wrenching scene.&lt;a href="http://http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/mar/28/deaf-40-year-old-women-hears-sound-first-time-video"&gt; Amateur footage showing her emotional reaction&lt;/a&gt; has taken social media by storm and touched viewers across the world, reinforcing the technological triumph of cochlear implants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its a story I have touched on before. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/16/bionic-ears-cochlear-implants-transformed-lives-children"&gt;Earlier this month I wrote about how cochlear implants changed the lives of the Campbells &lt;/a&gt;whose children Alice and Oliver were born with the condition auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). Implants, together with auditory verbal therapy, have allowed them to embrace the hearing world. It was incredibly moving to glimpse the long and difficult journey this family had experienced, and the joy that hearing - a sense so many of us take for granted - can bring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>From a white man in 'blackface' to a black Union soldier and an am-dram society dressed as a lynch mob, Mirror of Race's collection reveals a forgotten world of US race relations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/mar/28/mirror-race-america-slavery-19th-century-pictures"&gt; Shocking images from America's race war  in pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early photography is more than a window on history. It is an uncanny and disturbing encounter with real people, the light reflected off their faces falling on chemically sensitised surfaces long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera has been around now for nearly two centuries. Yet photographs from the 19th century have the same punch as pictures taken digitally today. We are not seeing mere pictures of people, but a trace of the people themselves, as they looked in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Inuit reject Oscar host's anti seal-hunting photo stunt and say practice is humane and sustainable&lt;p&gt;Canadian Inuit have embarked on a unique form of protest against the decision by host Ellen DeGeneres to highlight an anti seal-hunting charity on Oscars night. DeGeneres' Hollywood megastar &amp;quot;selfie&amp;quot; became the most retweeted snap of all time earlier this month, in the process raising $1.5m for the Humane Society of the United States, which campaigns against the seal hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My hero: George Orwell by John Carey</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/28/my-hero-george-orwell-john-carey</link>
      <description>Orwell was a truth-teller whose courage and sense of social justice made him a secular saint&lt;p&gt;I admire Orwell for how he lived as well as for how he wrote. He would have sneered at the notion that he was&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;saint  he once described the Christian heaven as &amp;quot;choir practice in a jeweller's shop&amp;quot;. All the same, for me&amp;nbsp;he was a secular saint. His road-toDamascus moment came when he&amp;nbsp;resigned from the Indian Imperial police in 1927. He was aware, he said, of an &amp;quot;immense weight of guilt&amp;quot; he&amp;nbsp;had to expiate, so he joined the beggars and outcasts, as described in &lt;a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141042701" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down and Out in Paris and London&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/Poor_Die/english/e_pdie" title=""&gt;How the Poor Die&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a truth-teller, admitting to feelings others would hide. In Burma he had found the taunts and insults of the radicalised Buddhist priests hard to bear. Part of him thought of the British Raj as a tyranny, but another part thought &amp;quot;the greatest joy in the world would be to drive a bayonet into a Buddhist priest's guts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alek Wek: 'You don't have to go with the crowd'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/mar/28/alek-wek-interview-sudanese-supermodel-dont-have-to-go-with-the-crowd</link>
      <description>As a teenager, Alek Wek shook up the fashion world  and inspired, among others, a young Lupita Nyong'o. The Sudanese supermodel tells Sali&amp;nbsp;Hughes why quirky is good&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.my-wardrobe.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.my-wardrobe.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alek Wek was 19 when she was approached by a&amp;nbsp;model scout from a top London agency at a fair in Crystal Palace park. Her mother, she remembers, was horrified, thinking her daughter was about to become a Page 3 girl. She laughs loudly: &amp;quot;I had to point out that I wasn't really built for that.&amp;quot; Wek, one of the most successful models of the past two decades, has inherited her father's height and extraordinarily long limbs, her mother's cheekbones and her &amp;quot;little booty and big smile&amp;quot;, but she's not exactly glamour-girl material. But the agent persisted, finally convincing Wek's mother that theirs was a reputable agency, and her daughter's career began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to New York and had been there barely a week when &lt;a href="http://www.ralphlauren.co.uk/home/index.jsp" title=""&gt;Ralph Lauren &lt;/a&gt;booked her to open and close his catwalk show (the spot normally reserved for the big model of the moment, not a newbie). &lt;a href="http://explore.calvinklein.com/en_US/explore" title=""&gt;Calvin Klein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/isaac-mizrahi" title=""&gt;Isaac Mizrahi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Oldham" title=""&gt;Todd Oldham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.annasui.com/en/" title=""&gt;Anna Sui&lt;/a&gt; followed suit. Wek was booked to star in Tina Turner's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkBYVNrjjIs" title=""&gt;GoldenEye video&lt;/a&gt;, named Model of the Year by &lt;a href="http://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/" title=""&gt;i-D magazine&lt;/a&gt; and, in 1997 (less than a year after starting out), became the first African model to appear on the &lt;a href="http://fabfashionfix.com/tag/elle-cover-1997-alek-wek/" title=""&gt;cover of Elle magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/28/steven-seagal-vladimir-putin-ukraine</link>
      <description>Action star has appeared in state-owned Russian media to back his personal friend the president and blast the west's anti-Putin stance on Ukraine&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin's decision to annexe the Crimean peninsula may be opposed by the combined political might of Europe and the USA, but one man stands ready to defend the Russian president. Action hero Steven Seagal, who considers Putin a personal friend, has labelled the former KGB lieutenant colonel &amp;quot;one of the greatest world leaders&amp;quot; and declared his actions in the Russian-majority Ukrainian province &amp;quot;very reasonable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Doc Martin and Men Behaving Badly star on throwing himself into plays to avoid being hit at school, having an uncle famous for playing Sherlock Holmes, and his love of animals&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My earliest memory is a picnic&lt;/strong&gt; in the park near our house, which was next to Wimbledon Common. Why on earth we went to a park when we lived so near the common is a mystery, but it&amp;nbsp;had formal gardens and lawns  perhaps it was that very difference that&amp;nbsp;took my parents there. As a child, I&amp;nbsp;remember being parked outside pubs with a bottle of pop and a packet of crisps and left to wait for the grownups. Later on, Wimbledon Common was my stamping ground  riding my bike, climbing trees  all sorts of hearty boy stuff.

      <title>How Johnny Cash became an even bigger star after his death</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/johnny-cash-out-among-the-stars-again</link>
      <description>The label that dropped the Man in Black in 1986 is now polishing up recordings from the same era, with the blessing of his estate and Rick Rubin, the producer who resurrected his career&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One person can't save another person, but almost,&amp;quot; Rosanne Cash once said about her father meeting the super-producer Rick Rubin. The union between the veteran country singer and the famed producer began in 1993 and resulted in a series of six albums (and a box set of outtakes) that revitalised Cash, both critically and commercially. He had spent the best part of 20 years in the wilderness, but the recordings re-established Johnny Cash as a great American artist  doubtless helped by their mythic banner name of &amp;quot;American&amp;quot;  and slowly restored him to public favour, too. Their first album, 1994's &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-recordings-mw0000111289" title=""&gt;American Recordings&lt;/a&gt;, only made No 23 on the US country music chart and 110 on the Billboard 200 (though they were his highest placings on those charts since 1978 and 1971, respectively), and its follow-up, Unchained, fared worse. However, by 2002's &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-iv-the-man-comes-around-mw0000662002" title=""&gt;American IV: The Man Comes Around&lt;/a&gt;, the man truly had come around. Propelled by &lt;a href="http://www.muzu.tv/johnny-cash/hurt-music-video/253029/" title=""&gt;the video for a cover of Nine Inch Nails' Hurt&lt;/a&gt;, the album went platinum in the US and cracked the top 40 here; then, after his death in 2003, Cash had his first No 1 album since 1969's At San Quentin with 2006's&lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-v-a-hundred-highways-mw0000421094" title=""&gt; American V: A Hundred Highways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American V was just the first in a slew of posthumous releases that includes 2010's &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-vi-aint-no-grave-mw0001958363" title=""&gt;American VI: Ain't No Grave&lt;/a&gt;, compilations of unreleased material (a four-volume bootleg series), expanded editions of classic albums and numerous greatest-hits packages. In total, press cuttings list 37 compilations on a variety of labels since his death, plus one collaboration album, one gospel album, two live albums and three studio albums. The best of these releases were bought in large numbers (American VI, the last album proper, has sold 250,000 copies in the US and 62,000 in the UK) and it's into this fertile environment that Cash's estate, which is privately owned by his family, is now releasing a &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; record from the early 1980s, Out Among the Stars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/28/rio-ferdinand-manchester-united-season-embarrassing</link>

His decision to speak publicly will also be noted by the club executives who so far have remained firm in their backing of Moyes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Villagers from Wang Nuea in northern Thailand look for gold in the river every year during the dry season. They can make about $15 a day, though two years ago they reached $200 in a single day when the river level dropped more than usual. The workers begin to search at 10am and work until sunset, often doing second jobs in order to survive&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The &lt;a href="http://attitude.co.uk/"&gt;gay lifestyle magazine Attitude&lt;/a&gt; was launched in 1994 and to celebrate its 20th anniversary, the editor Matthew Todd, who says it feels serendipitous that Attitude turns 20 just as people of the same sex can begin marrying in England and Wales, has picked some of his favourite covers from over the years. They include the Harry Potter star, twice, The Voice coach Kylie Minogue and stars such as Lady Gaga, David Beckham, Ian McKellen, plus the five collectible covers for the anniversary, one of which features Ed Miliband</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/gallery/2014/mar/27/charity-shop-fashion-tips-gallery</link>
      <description>As &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17667524"&gt;vintage shopping becomes increasingly popular&lt;/a&gt; charity shops are seizing the opportunity to get involved. Organisations are making the most of recycling and offering revamped pieces in their stores. They are also picking up tips from the high street stores on how best to showcase their products. Oxfam, British Heart Foundation, CLIC Sargent and Ty Hafan have all adopted new methods and ideas to sell their stock and make the most money for their causes.</description>

      <title>Eleven photos that define 'American Cool'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/mar/27/eleven-photos-that-define-american-cool</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do we mean when we say someone is cool? A &lt;a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/exhibit/Cool/index.html"&gt;new exhibition&lt;/a&gt; at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery will explore this very theme,  through photography, history and popular culture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Cool is the opposite of innocence or virtue. Someone cool has a charismatic edge and a dark side.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All photos courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
